            "Target: In the year 1978, a proviso was added to Rule 3(j) of the Bar Council of Delhi Election Rules, 1968 with the approval of the Bar Council of India in accordance with the requirement of Sub section (3) of section 15 of the . In accordance with that proviso a copy of the declaration form was sent on 14th June, 1978 to the Advocates whose names found place in the State roll of Advocates asking them to return the declaration form duly filled up and signed within the specified period. A publication to this effect was also made in some newspapers viz. Hindustan Times, Indian Express, Statesman etc. The last extended date for the submission of the declaration forms was 14th September, 1978 and the electoral roll was finally published on the 16th September, 1978 excluding the names of about 2,000 Advocates who had failed to submit such declaration forms. On the basis of the electoral roll so prepared, elections to the Bar Council of Delhi was held on the 17th November, 1978. The total number of advocates on the Advocates roll was 5,000 and odd out of which the names of about 3,000 and odd only were included in the electoral roll in accordance with the proviso to Rule 3(j) of the Election Rules of the Bar Council of Delhi. The results of the election were declared on the 19th November, 1978. The names of the 15 persons who were declared elected were published in the Gazette on the 22nd November, 1978. Thereafter the respondents in these appeals filed writ petitions challenging the whole election by attacking the validity of the proviso to Rule 3(j). The Delhi High Court allowed the three writ petitions taking the view, (i) so far as the qualifications to be possessed by and the conditions to be satisfied by an advocate before being brought on to the Electoral Roll was concerned only the Bar Council of India has the competence to make the rules under section 3(4) and section 49(1)(a) of the and the State Bar Council has no power at all to make a rule on this subject; (ii) the plea of estoppel against Surjeet Singh does not arise, (iii) rank injustice has been done to the petitioners because more than 2000 advocates were wrongfully disqualified being brought on the Electoral Roll. This has materially affected the result of the elections; and (iv) Rule 3(j) of the Bar Council of Delhi Election Rules, 1968 is in excess of the rules making power of Bar Council of Delhi. Dismissing the appeals by special leave the Court, ^ HELD: 1. The impugned proviso to Rule 3(j) of the Delhi Bar Council of Election Rules is ultra vires and invalid and the electoral roll prepared by 947 the Delhi Bar Council on the basis of the same resulting in the exclusion of the names of about 2000 advocates from the said roll was not valid in law. [958D E] (b) The whole election was invalid on that account and it could be challenged as such in a writ petition. It was not a case of challenging the preparation of the electoral roll on the factual basis of wrong exclusion of a few names. For the said purpose Rule 4 occurring in Chapter I of the Bar Council of India Rules could come into play. But here, because of the invalidity of the Rules itself, the preparation of the electoral roll was completely vitiated a matter which cannot be put within the narrow limit of the said rule. [958E F] However, it depends upon the nature and the intensity of the error committed in the preparation of the electoral roll and its effect on the whole election for deciding the question as to whether a writ petition would be maintainable or not.

(c) The illegal preparation of the electoral roll by the Delhi Bar Council on the basis of the invalid proviso to Rule 3(j) goes to the very root of the matter and no election held on the basis of such an infirmity can be upheld. There is no question of the result being materially affected in such a case. [958F G] (d) The contesting respondents could not be defeated in their writ petitions on the ground of estoppel or the principle that one cannot approbate and reprobate or that they were guilty of laches. In the first instance some of the contesting respondents were merely voters. Even Sri Surjeet Singh in his writ petition claimed to be both a candidate and a voter. As a voter he could challenge the election even assuming that as a candidate after being unsuccessful he was estopped from doing so. But, merely because he took part in the election by standing as a candidate or by exercise of his right of franchise he cannot be estopped from challenging the whole election when the election was glaringly illegal and void on the basis of the obnoxious proviso. There is no question of approbation and reprobation in such a case. A voter could come to the High Court even earlier before the election was held. But merely because he came to challenge the election after it was held it cannot be said that he was guilty of laches and must be non suited on that account.

(e) The manner of resolving disputes as to the validity of election is provided for in Rule 34 of the Delhi Bar Council Election Rules. This is not an 948 appropriate and adequate alternative remedy to defeat the writ petitioner on that account. Firstly, no clause of Rule 34 covers the challenging of the election on the ground that it has been done in this case. Secondly, the Election Tribunal will not be competent to declare any provision of the Election Rules ultra vires and invalid. It is not a case where the name of any voter was wrongly omitted from the electoral roll but it is a case where the preparation of the whole electoral roll was null and void because of the invalidity of the impugned proviso.

If the alternative remedy fully covers the challenge to the election then that remedy and that remedy alone must be resorted to even though it involves the challenge of the election of all the successful candidates. But if the nature and the ground of the challenge of the whole election are such that the alternative remedy is no remedy in the eye of law to cover the challenge or, in any event, is not adequate and efficacious remedy, then the remedy of writ petition to challenge the whole election is still available. In the present case the Election Tribunal would have found itself incompetent to declare the proviso to Rule 3(j) of the Delhi Bar Council Election Rules ultra vires and that being so the alternative remedy provided in Rule 34(8) was no remedy at all.

So long the existing rules framed by the Bar Council of India remained in vogue all persons whose names are on the State Roll are entitled proprio vigore to be put on the electoral roll. Sections 24(e) (1) and 26A of the read with Rules 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter I of of the Bar Council of India Rules make this position clear. [954A B, D H] 4. On a plain reading of sub sections 4 of section 3 of the , it is manifest that under the Act the qualifications and conditions entitling an advocate to vote at an election or for being chosen as a member of the State Bar Council has to be prescribed by the Bar Council of India. The State Bar Council has no such power. The power of the State Bar Council is merely to prepare and revise from time to time the electoral roll subject to the Rules made by the Bar Council of India concerning the qualifications and conditions aforesaid. This interpretation of Section 3(4) of the Act finds ample support from the very special and specific provision contained in section 49(1) (a) providing for the general power of the Bar Council of India. [956F H] 949 5. It is true that the power to make rules conferred by section 15 is both for the Bar Council of India as also for the Bar Council of a State. But no provision of section 15 can override the specific provision made in section 3(4) and section 49(1)(a) of the Act. Sub section (1) of section 15 says \"A Bar Council may make rules to carry out the purposes of this Chapter\" which means Chapter II including section 3. But the power to prescribe qualifications and conditions entitling an advocate to vote at an election being that of the Bar Council of India section 15(1) cannot be interpreted to confer power on the State Bar Council to make rules regarding the qualifications and conditions aforesaid. [957B D] The State Bar Council can frame rules for the preparation and revision of electoral rolls under section 15(2)(a). That would be in conformity with the latter part of sub section (4) of section 3 also. But in the garb of making a rule for the preparation and revision of the electoral rolls it cannot prescribe disqualifications, qualifications or conditions subject to which an advocate whose name occurs in the State roll can find place in the electoral roll resulting in his deprivation of his right to vote at the election. In the instant case under the impugned proviso failure on the part of an advocate to submit the required declaration within the specified time entitles the State Bar Council to exclude his name from the electoral roll. Such a thing was squarely covered by the exclusive power conferred on the Bar Council of India under sections 3(4) and 49(1)(a) of the . The State Bar Council had no such power. [957F H] 6. The approval of the Bar Council of India can make the rule made by the State Bar Council valid and effective only if the rule made is within the competence of the State Bar Council otherwise not. Mere approval by the Bar Council of India to a rule ultra vires the State Bar Council cannot make the rule valid. Nor has it the effect of a rule made by the Bar Council of India. Making a rule by the Bar Council of India and giving approval to a rule made by the State Bar Council are two distinct and different things. One cannot take the place of the other. [958B D] \n",

            "Target: The appellant is a resident of Tripura State. He assert ed that he belonged to the Laskar community which was in cluded in State records in the Deshi Tripura community and in the former State of Tripura this community had always been treated as Scheduled Tribes, and the members of the community freely enjoyed all the benefits available to members of the Scheduled Tribes until 1976 when the State Government decided to treat members of this community as not belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and issued instructions to the state authorities to implement the Government decision. Being aggrieved the appellant filed a writ petition before the High Court in a representative capacity praying for appropriate directions directing the State Government to continue to treat the appellant and members of Laskar commu nity as belonging to Scheduled Tribes and extend all the benefits available to Scheduled Tribes to this community. In support of his claim the appellant relied upon the two circulars of the erstwhile State of Tripura dated December 1930 and February 1941 as also the census report of the ex state of Tripura, besides the authorities of this Court. The respondent took the plea that Laskar community was never included in the Scheduled Tribes Order and as such there was no question of excluding it from the List. After considering the rival contentions of the parties coupled with the his torical background bearing on the subject, the statement made by the Advocate General that the Memos will be given prospective operation, the High Court dismissed the Writ Petition. Hence this appeal by Special Leave. This appeal initially came up before a two judges Bench for final hear ing when on a statement made by the Counsel for the Union of India that a representation made by the appellant and mem bers of his community for inclusion their caste Laskar, in the Presidential order under Article 342 is being looked into and is being placed before the Parliamentary Committee for review of the position, the Court disposed of the appeal in terms of the assurance 577 given on behalf of the Union. It was specifically stated in the Court 's order that in case the community is not included in the Presidential Order, it would be open to the appellant to take such action as may be available to him in law. Nothing having happened at governmental level, with the consent of the parties, the order disposing of the appeal was recalled and the appeal has thus now come up for hear ing. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: Reservation has become important in view of the increasing competition in society and that probably had led to the anxiety of the appellant and the people in his commu nity to claim reservation. [586G] In Tripura the Scheduled Tribes within the meaning of the definition given in Article 366 of the Constitution have been 'Jamatia, Noatia, Riang and Tripura/Tripuri/Tippera ' apart from 15 other tribes. It is the case of the appellant that Laskars are a part of the tribe named as 'Tripura, Tripuri and Tippera ' covered by Entry 18. [581D] This Court should not assume jurisdiction and enter into an enquiry to determine whether the three terms indicated in the Presidential Order include Deshi Tripura which covers the Laskar community; but it is appropriate to commend to the authorities concerned that as and when the question is reviewed it should be examined whether the claim of the appellant representing the Laskar community to be included in the scheduled tribes is genuine and should, therefore, be entertained. [586F G] Even if historically this tribe was covered by the general description of Tripura, that by itself may not justify its inclusion in the Order as a Scheduled Tribe. That is an additional feature which has weighed with us in taking our decision not to interfere in the matter. [587C] B. Basavalingappa vs D.

The appellant urged that this application was made as a matter of abundant caution and it wanted the Tribunal to consider the question as to whether the respondent was a workman concerned in the relevant industrial dispute at all before dealing with the merits of the application. The Tribunal, being of the view that if the appellant thought that s, 33 did not apply, it should withdraw the application and take the consequences, dealt with the merits of the application. In appeal by special leave: HELD: The Tribunal was in error in not considering the preliminary point raised by the appellant that the respondent was not a workman concerned with the main industrial dispute and as such the application made by it was unnecessary. [431E] It is plain that in a situation like the present, where judicial decisions differed on the construction of the words \"workman concerned in such dispute\", even if the appellant took the view that the workman against whom it was taking action was not a workman concerned with the main industrial disputes, it would be justified in refusing to take the risk of deciding the said point for itself.

            "Target: The appellant is engaged in the business of manufacture of various pharmaceutical products including sulphamethoxa zole which is also known as 'SMX '. One of the important ingredients or raw materials for the manufacture of SMX is a chemical known as 'isoxamine '. On April 23, 1974 the Ministry of Industrial Development of the Government of India issued to the appellant an indus trial licence enabling it to manufacture 18 tonnes of SMX per year. Under one of the conditions of the industrial licence, the appellant was permitted to import the material, isoxamine, for a period of two years only from the date of licence, and thereafter the product SMX was to be manufac tured from indigenous materials. The appellant 's request for permission to import isoxamine till the middle of 1979 was not acceded to by the Government and the appellant was asked to manufacture SMX from indigenous materials. In the mean time, the appellant had placed orders for the import of isoxamine under an import licence issued on October 13, 1976, and between March and June 1979 got the goods cleared after giving a declaration that the appellant was an Actual User, and that its registration had not been cancelled or withdrawn or otherwise made inoperative. 496 The Collector of Customs, Bombay, issued show cause notice on the appellant for confiscation of goods and impo sition of penalty, inter alia, on the ground that it had made a false statement that its registration had not been cancelled, withdrawn or otherwise made inoperative for the manufacture of SMX by using imported material, that is, isoxamine, inasmuch as the industrial licence had ceased to be valid for the manufacture of SMX with imported material after April 22, 1976. The Collector of Customs, after bearing the appellant, held that the appellant was not an Actual User (Industrial) in respect of the said imported raw material, isoxamine, after April 22, 1976, and that since the industrial licence was invalid for manufacture of SMX with imported material the importation of the raw material, namely, isoxamine, was impermissible. The Collector also held that the appellant had furnished a false declaration on the basis of which it got the goods cleared by the Custom Officer. The Collector, therefore, set aside the decision of the Custom Officer allowing clearance of the goods. The Collector of Customs further directed confiscation of the goods imported by the appellant and also imposed a penalty. The appellant 's writ petition was dismissed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court, and appeal against his judgment was dismissed by the Division Bench. Before this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the goods, namely, isoxamine, having been imported under a valid Open General Licence (OGL), the customs authorities had no jurisdiction to confiscate the same; that the appellant having secured the OGL for the import of isoxamine for its own use and not for business or trade in it, the appellant should be held to be an Actual User; that the Collector of Customs could not, in exercise of his revisional jurisdiction under section 130(2) of the , as it stood then, for the first time confiscate the goods and impose penalty on the appellant; and that as the goods have been confiscated and the penalty has been imposed by the Collector of Customs in exercise of his revisional jurisdiction, the appellant has been deprived of his right to prefer an appeal before the Central Board of Excise and Customs under Section 128(a) of the . While dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: (1) There can be no doubt that the definition of \"Actual User (Industrial)\", as contained in clause (3) of paragraph 5 of chapter 2 of Import Policy 1978 79 should be read with the definition of \"Actual 497 User\" in clause (1) of paragraph 5. So read, it is clear that an \"Actual User (Industrial)\" means an industrial undertaking which is entitled to utilise the imported goods \"in the manufacturing process or operations conducted within its authorised premises. In other words, the importer must not be debarred from utilising the imported goods under the terms of the industrial licence. [504C D] (2) The declaration of the appellant that it is an Actual User, and that its registration has not been other wise made inoperative is a false declaration, as rightly held by the Collector of Customs. When the industrial li cence granted to the appellant does not permit the use of the imported goods for the manufacture of SMX, the importa tion of the goods under the OGL is illegal and could not be allowed to be cleared by the appellant. [505A B] (3) In view of the provisions of section 122 read with section 124 of the , the Collector of Customs has the jurisdiction to confiscate goods or impose penalty after issuing show cause notice. He has, therefore, both the original jurisdiction as also revisional jurisdiction. In exercise of his revisional jurisdiction under section 130(2) of the Act, he set aside the order of the Customs Officer allowing the goods to be cleared by the appellant and, thereafter, in exercise of his original jurisdiction under section 122 read with section 124 of the Act, he issued a show cause notice on the appellant and, after hearing the appellant, confiscated the goods and imposed penalty on the appellant. [506E F] (4) It appears, however, that the confiscation was made and the penalties imposed by the Collector of Customs in exercise of his revisional power under section 130(2) of the act. This is a mere irregularity not affecting the order. When an authority has the power to do a certain act and in exercise of such power he does the same, but refers to a wrong provision of the law, that would be a mere irregulari ty and would not vitiate such act. [506G H; 507A] Addl. Commissioner of Income Tax vs J.K. D 'Costa, , distinguished. (5) In the order of the Collector it has been specifi cally stated at the very outset that an appeal against the order lies to the Central Board of Excise and Customs.

Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1972, which came into force on 8.6.1973, no tenure holder would he entitled to hold in the aggregate throughout Uttar Pradesh, any land in excess of the 'ceiling area ', as defined in Sub s.(2) ors.3 of the Act. Since Smt. Anma Begum, the tenure holder was holding in the aggregate land in excess of the ceiling area, she became liable to surrender the surplus land. Pursuant to a general notice issued under s.9 to all tenure Imlders, holding land in excess of the ceiling area, she did not file any state ment before the Prescribed Authority After the publication of the general notice but before she could he served with a notice under s.10(2) she died. The Prescribed Authority not knowing of her death issued a notice under s.10(2) calling upon her to show cause why the statement prepared by him under section 10(1) should not he taken as correct. The father of respondent No. 4, one of the .heirs, filed objections which were over ruled, and it was declared that Smt. Arena Begum was holding 17.37 hectares of land as surplus land. The District Judge holding that since the tenure holder was dead by the time the notice under section 10(2) was issued, the order of the Prescribed Authority passed against a dead person could not be allowed to stand, allowed the appeal, set aside the order of the Prescribed Authority and remanded the case. Fresh notices under s.10(2) were issued to the heirs. Respondent No. 3 contended that she held only 91.12 bighas of land as her onefourth share and that 12 acres of land had been transferred through registered sale deed far adequate consideration and in good faith and 100 the land to that extent should be excluded from the holding while determining the surplus land and that the determina tion of the surplus land should be made on the basis of the share held by each of them as an individual tenure holder. The Prescribed Authority held that there was no surplus land that could be claimed from the holding in question since none of the heirs of deceased tenure holder was in possession of the land in excess of the ceiling area. The appeal by the State Government against the order of the Prescribed Authority was dismissed by the Civil Judge holding that Smt. Anma Begum could not be treated as a tenure holder after her death, and that since none of the heirs of Amna Begum was holding the land in excess of the ceiling area they were not liable to surrender any surplus land. The petition under Article 226 filed by the State Gov ernment was dismissed holding that the State Government was not entitled to question the correctness of the orders of the Prescribed Authority and the Civil Judge as the order of remand of the case passed by the District Judge had become final. Allowing the Appeal, HELD: 1. The orders passed by the High Court, the Civil Judge and the Prescribed Authority are set aside and the case is remanded to the Prescribed Authority for fresh disposal. [107D] 2. The reason given by the High Court for holding that the contentions urged on behalf of the State Government were barred by the rule of res judicata is wholly untenable since the District Judge while remanding the case had nut recorded any finding on the merits of the contentions of the parties. He had set aside the order of the Prescribed Authority passed earlier only on the ground that a proceeding which had been commenced against a dead person was a nullity. He, however, remanded the case to the Prescribed Authority for fresh disposal in accordance with law after issuing notices to the heirs of Smt. Amna Begum whom he wrongly described as tenure holders so far as her estate was concerned. The High Court was, therefore, wrong in dismissing the writ petition on that ground. [104D 105A] 3. Smt. Amna Begum was alive on 8.6.1973 on which date ceiling 101 on the holdings in the State of Uttar Pradesh was imposed by s.5 of the Act. Amna Begum became liable to surrender the surplus land in excess of what she could retain in accordance with that section. Merely because she had died before the issue of the notice under s.10(2) of the Act the liability to surrender the surplus land would not come to an end. [105C] 4. Rule 19 of the Uttar Pradesh Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Rules, 1961 framed under the Act provides that where a tenure holder dies before the publication of the general notice under s.9 of the Act, such publication shah be deemed to apply to the executor, administrator or other legal representatives and the Prescribed Authority may proceed to determine the ceiling area applicable to the deceased person as if such executor administrator of other legal representatives were the tenure holder It also pro vides that where a tenure holder dies before he is served with a notice under sub section (2) of section 10 of the Act, the Prescribed Authority may serve such notice on his executor, administrator or other legal representatives and may proceed to determine the ceiling area applicable to the deceased person as if such executor, administrator or other legal representatives were the tenureholders. [105D F] 5. The principle applicable to the determination of the surplus land under the land reform laws in the hands of person holding land is the date on which the ceiling is imposed. [105G] 6. 'The surplus land in the case of a person who held land in excess of the ceiling area on the appointed day had to he determined as an the appointed day even though such person might have died before the actual extent of surplus land was determined ,tad notified.

For the purpose of deciding the surplus land which is liable to be surrendered from and out of the estate of Smt. Arena Begum, the relevant date that might be taken into account is 8.6.1973 on which date the ceiling on holdings was imposed and she became liable to surrender the surplus land. Her hews or legal representatives together are enti tled 102 to retain out of her estate only an extent of land equal to the area which she could have retained in her hands after the imposition of ceiling on land holdings and are liable to surrender the surplus land.

Consequent upon the decision of the State Government to reorganise the Higher Judicial Service it was decided that a number of posts of the cadre of Additional District & Sessions Judges be abolished and the incumbents of those posts be absorbed as District & Sessions Judges. The High Court at one of the High Court meetings held to screen the officers in the cadre of Additional District & Sessions Judges, decided to retire the appellant compulsorily on his at tanning the age of SS years under Rule 56(3)(a) of the Fundamental Rules. It was also decided not to recommend him for promotion to the cadre of District and Sessions Judges. The appellant was served with an order of compulsory retirement dated August 28, 1981. The Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the appellant 's writ petition impugning his compulsory retirement. In the appeal to this Court, it was contended that the High Court had made the recommendation to retire the appellant compulsorily without applying its mind and that the decision was based on collateral considerations and was arbitrary. On behalf of the High Court it was contended that the personal confidential records of the appellant were considered by the Full Court Meeting and the decision to retire the appellant under Fundamental Rule 56(3)(a) was taken after due consideration of the entire record. Allowing the appeal: ^ HELD: 1. It would be an act bordering on perversity to dig out old files to find out some material to make an order against an officer.

All the reports except for 1972 73 and 1973 74 were good and quite satisfactory. Even in the reports of the said years there was nothing to doubt his integrity. He was punctual in attending to his work. The reports for the years 1976 77 to 1980 81 speak in favour of the appellant and not against him. A perusal of the said reports showed that there was nothing against him. In these circumstances it was impossible to take the view that the appellant was liable to be compulsorily retired.

            "Target: The assessee in these appeals is an Hindu Undivided Family The assessment years in question are ranged from 1942 43 to 1953 54. The assessee filed its returns for these years in time. The assessee 's account books showed considerable cash credits in the name of some relations of the second respondent, the Karta of the H.U.F. The I.T.O. went into the genuineness of these cash credit entries. The contention of the assessee was substantially accepted either by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner or by the Revenue Appellate Tribunal. With regard to the, assessment for the assessment years 1943 44 to 1949 50, the final assessment was made in pursuance of an agreement or settlement arrived between the assessee and the Deputy Director of Inspection (Investiga tion). Long after the assessments in question were finalised, the I.T.O. issued notices to the appellants under section 34(1) (a) of the Indian Income Tax Act 1922, seeking to reopen the assessments already finalised. The assessee challenged the validity of these notices of the I.T.O. The High Court allowed the writ petitions and quashed the impugned notices. The assessee alleged that there was no relevant material before the I.T.O. before he issued the notices under s 31(a) on the basis of which he could have reason to believe that any income had escaped assessment. In the writ petitions, the assessee called upon the I.T.O. to produce the report made by him to the Central Board of Revenue, as well as the order of the Central Board of Revenue thereon. Despite this prayer, neither the Union of India, nor the I.T.O produced the report made by the I.T.O. to the Central Board of Revenue under s.34(1)(a) nor the order of the Central Board of Revenue. Dismissing the appeal, HELD : (i) Before an I.T.O. can issue a statutory notice under s.34(1)(a), he must have reason to believe that by reason of omission ,or failure on the part of an assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for the years in question, income, profits or gains chargeable to Income Tax have escaped assessment during those years. Further, before doing so, he must have recorded his reasons for acting under section 34(1) (a) and the Central Board of Revenue must have been satisfied on those reasons that it is a fit case for the issue of the notice. The recording of the reasons in support of the belief formed by the I.T.O. and the satisfaction of the Central Board of Revenue on the basis of the reasons recorded by the I.T.O. that it is a fit case for issue of notice under section 34(1) (a) are extremely important circumstances to find out whether the I.T.O. has jurisdiction to proceed under s.34(1)(a).

Assuming that the concerned records were missing from the file of the Central Board of Revenue, the copy of the report made by the I.T.O. and the Order received by him, must have been in the file of the I.T.O. and reason was given for not producing those records. These circumstances give rise to an adverse inference that the records in question were not produced because they did not assist the department 's case. Under the circumstances, it is not possible to come to the conclusion that the facts necessary to confer jurisdiction on the I.T.O. to proceed under s.34(1)(a) had been established.

            "Target: National Savings and Investments (NS&I) is a non ministerial Government department offering retail savings and investments to UK customers. It also provides support functions to other public bodies, referred to as business to business services or B2B services [2]. NS&I has outsourced its own operational services. In 2013 it entered into a contract with Atos IT Services Limited (Atos) to purchase support services including transaction management, printing, accounting, IT and customer services [3]. The award of the Atos contract followed a competitive tender process which complied with EU law on public procurement, as implemented in domestic law by the Public Contract Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations). It was envisaged in the tender documents and in the Atos contract that it could be extended to support new B2B services provided by NS&I [13]. The Government announced it would replace tax relief for employers who contribute to their employees child care costs with a new scheme of tax free childcare (TFC). The TFC scheme involves parents setting up childcare accounts into which HMRC contributes a 20% top up, capped at 2,000 per year [16]. On 29 July 2014 HM Treasury decided that NS&I would deliver the new TFC policy for HMRC by providing and administering the childcare accounts and supporting services [21]. The arrangements between HMRC and NS&I were to be set out in a memorandum of understanding. NS&I proposed to modify its contract with Atos to include services related to TFC [23], without any government body undertaking a public procurement process in relation to this work. The appellants are Edenred (UK Group) Limited, a company which provided services to employers under the old tax relief scheme, and the Childcare Voucher Providers Association [1]. They considered that EU procurement law required a new tender process [6]. They commenced proceedings seeking declarations that the proposed TFC arrangements were unlawful under the 2006 Regulations and an order restraining the modification of the Atos contract. On 27 October 2014 they were granted an interim order preventing the implementation of TFC [25]. An expedited trial took place before Andrews J in November 2014. She dismissed the claim, holding that the proposed variation of the Atos contract would not breach EU procurement law [26]. The appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal, but their appeal was dismissed on 31 March 2015 [26]. The Supreme Court heard the appellants application for permission to appeal at the same time as their substantive appeal, in order to provide a prompt determination [5]. The Supreme Court grants the appellants permission to appeal but unanimously dismisses their appeal. The interim order preventing the implementation of TFC is set aside [50]. Lord Hodge, with whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Sumption, Lord Carnwath agree, gives the judgment. The principal purpose of EU procurement law is to develop effective competition in the field of public contracts. Public contracts over a threshold value must be advertised and awarded according to fair and transparent procedures to ensure equality of treatment between potential service providers [28]. Amendments to an existing public contract will fall within the procurement regime and be treated in substance as the award of a new contract if they involve a material variation of the contract [29]. The 2006 Regulations were replaced by the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (implementing Directive 2014/24/EU) which came into force on 26 February 2015. The 2015 Regulations will govern the amendment of the Atos contract if the respondents proceed with that amendment [6], and represent an updated statement of EU procurement law [30]. Therefore, the judgment refers to reg.72 of the 2015 Regulations which sets out the circumstances in which a contracting authority may modify a public contract without a new procurement process [31]. A fresh procurement is not required where the modifications to the contract are not substantial (reg.72(1)(e)). The appellants argued that the proposed amendments to the Atos contract were substantial because they extended the scope of the contract considerably (reg.72(8)(d)), encompassing services not initially covered [33]. This argument did not succeed. The original contract covered operational services to support both NS&Is existing functions and (as an object of the contract) the expansion of B2B services [34]. The prohibition on modification to encompass services not initially covered does not preclude expansion that is envisaged and advertised in the initial procurement process. The question is whether the services were covered by the original contract, including its provisions for contractual variation. Otherwise, outsourced services would not be able to accommodate the events and policy changes that are part of public life [36]. Although contracts may not be designed to avoid EU law obligations, the expansion provided for in this case was within a reasonable compass. It did not alter the essential nature of the operational services provided and included restrictions to maintain the economic balance of the contract and Atos profit margin [37]. A new tendering process may also be dispensed with if the proposed contractual variation has been provided for in the initial procurement documents in clear, precise and unequivocal review clauses (reg.72(1)(a)). Lord Hodge inclines to the view that this criterion is also satisfied [43] but comments that the nature of the review clauses covered by the regulation is open to debate [44]; such debate was not necessary to resolve in order to determine the appeal [45]. The appellants argued alternatively that there was in substance a public service contract between HMRC and Atos [46], on the basis that provisions in the memorandum of understanding between HMRC and NS&I were legally binding and were repeated in the proposed modification to the Atos contract, and that HMRC was the service recipient of B2B services provided by, and discussed with, Atos [47]. However, NS&I is an existing public body with an established remit apart from the TFC scheme, using outsourced resources to provide B2B services to other public bodies. There is no legal basis for airbrushing it out of the picture. The memorandum of understanding and the Atos contract are legally distinct. It is NS&I, not HMRC, that can enforce the Atos contract. The appellants contention that NS&I would be under a statutory legal obligation to comply with the memorandum of understanding (which is not in itself an enforceable contract) by virtue of s.16 of the Childcare Payments Act 2014 misinterpreted the effect of that section. Any public body receiving B2B services from NS&I may discuss those services with the outsourced provider, but that does not alter the substance of the transaction [48]. \n",

The appellants contended before this Court that if the sale was ab initio void, the agricultural tenancy (of the appellant%; revived.

When that sale was found to be void it did not have the effect (if reviving the merged tenancy of the appellants,as would restore their tenancy right,; in the disputed lands.

The manufacture was made at its mills in Indore which was an Indian State before integra tion and had its own law as to income tax known as the Indore Industrial Tax Rules, 1927. The sales of textile goods so manufactured were made at various places, some inside and some outside the taxable territories of the then British India. For and upto assessment year 1949 50 the assessee company was treated as a non resident. Indore became a part of the taxable territories within the meaning of the Indian 311 Income tax Act, 1922 in the two assessment years 1950 51 and 1951 52 and the asscssee company was held to be \"resident and ordinarily resident\" within the meaning of that Act. Upto the assessment year 1949 50 that part of its profits which was received by the assessee company in British India was subjected to tax together with it. ,; other income which accrued in British India. In making the calculation of business profits or loss received or arising in the taxable territories, a proportion was struck between the total turnover and its sales the proceeds whereof were received in the taxable territories. The assessee company raised two questions in the course of the assessment proceedings, one of which with regard to the entire loss of Rs. 5,19,590/ of the year 1948 49 which it claimed to set off against the profits made in its business in the two assessment years. The assessee company contended that the business was one and under section 24 it was entitled to set off the losses which it had sustained in 1948 49. The High Court decided this question against the assessee company, but gave a certificate under section 66A of the Act.

Madras on April 6, 1965 to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication. Tribunal awarded bonus at 2O,% of the consolidated wages as provided in the . As to medical benefit& the Tribunal diverted that the company should pay the cost of medicines prescribed by the company 's doctor and the full cost of hospitalisation when it was. recomanded by the company 's doctor. The Tribunal modified, the company '& gratuity scheme in accordance with the workmen 's demands. The company appealed to, this Court against the award The question of bonus had to be considered, in, the light of this Courts decision in Japan Trading, Company 's law. On the question. of medical benefits the Court had to consider whether the company 's scheme for its Calcutta employees could be extended to Madras Region. In regard to gratuity the main questions for consideration were as, to, the qualifying, period for payment of gratuity to workmen who were guilty of misconduct, and whether gratuity should be payable for workmen whose misconduct consisted of violence, riotous behaviour etc. HELD: (i) In View of this Court 's decision in Jalian Trading Company 's case the. Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 was not applicable in respect of the year in question, and the bonus payable had to be calculated in accordance with, the Full Bench, Formula. The award to that extent therefore had to be set aside and remanded, to the Tribunal for determining the bonus in accordance with the said Formula [937 E] Jalam Trading Co. vs Mill Mazdoor Union, ; , referred to. (ii) In the appellant company 's earlier cases relating to its Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kerala Branched this Court had held that the Company 's Calcutta scheme relating to medical benefit for its workmen was fair and reasonable and had made the said scheme applicable to these areas also. No substantial difference had been shown between these areas and the Madras region affecting the question of medical benefit. These areas and the no legitimate reason why the Calcutta scheme should not be applied to the workmen in the present case. [The Court framed an eight point scheme for medical benefit based on the Calcutta scheme] [939 A 940 C] Remington Rand of India vs The Workmen, C.A. Nos. 856/68 etc. 10 12 1968, applied. (iii.) Once the principal, that gratuity is paid to ensure good conduct throughout the period that the workman serves his employer as laid drown 936 in Calcutta Insurance Co. some distinction in the matter of the qualifying period between cases of resignation and retirement on the one hand and dismissal for misconduct on the other becomes logically necessary. Such a distinction cannot legitimately be assailed as unreasonable. Similarly if the object underlying the scheme of gratuity is to secure industrial harmony and satisfaction among workmen it is impossible to equate cases of death, physical incapacity, retirement and resignation with cases of termination of service incurred on account of misconduct. Besides, a longer qualifying period in the latter cases would ensure restraint against wailful use of violence and force, neglect etc. [948 E] As laid down in Delhi Cloth & General Mills case that acts amounting to misconduct as defined in the standing orders, when they are made, or the model standing orders, where they are applicable differ in degree of gravity, nature and their impact on the discipline and the working of the concern, and that though grave in their nature all of them may not result in loss capable of being calculated in terms of money. Amongst, them there would be some which would forthwith disentitle the workman from retaining his employment and justifying his dismissal. For the reasons given in the Delhi Cloth & General Mills case it was necessary to modify the scheme of gratuity and to add in cl. 5 thereof a proviso that in cases where there has been termination of service on account of an employee found guilty of act or acts involving violence against the management or other employees or riotous or disorderly be haviour in or near the company 's premises, the company would be entitled to forfeit the gratuity which would otherwise be payable to the concerned workmen. Clause 5 should also be modified so as to introduce therein 15 years continuous service as the qualifying period for earning gratuity in cases when the service of an employee has been terminated on account of misconduct and that such gratuity should be payable at the rate prescribed in cl. 3(d) of the scheme.

            "Target: These appeals concern the obligations of insurance companies under various contracts of employers liability (EL) insurance. In particular, the appeals concern the scope of the insurers obligations to indemnify employers against their liabilities towards employees who have contracted mesothelioma following exposure to asbestos. Mesothelioma has an unusually long gestation period, which can be in excess of 40 years between exposure to asbestos and manifestation of the disease. The insurers maintain that the EL policies only cover mesothelioma which manifested as a disease at some point during the relevant policy period. In contrast, the employers submit that the insurance policies respond to mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos during the relevant policy period but which develops and manifests itself sometime later. The usual rule in negligence cases is that the claimant must establish on the balance of probabilities that the defendants negligence caused his injury or disease. In Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2002] UKHL 22 and Barker v Corus UK Ltd [2006] UKHL 20 the House of Lords developed an exception to this general principle in cases involving mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos. The effect of this special rule is that an employer is liable where exposure to asbestos contributed to the risk that the employee would suffer mesothelioma and where the employee in fact develops the disease. The insurers submit that the special rule in Fairchild/Barker is not applicable when deciding, for the purposes of an EL insurance policy, whether an employees mesothelioma was caused by exposure to asbestos during a particular policy year. At first instance Burton J held that the policies should all be interpreted as having a causation wording. He therefore held that the liability trigger under the EL policy was when the employee inhaled the asbestos and not the date when the malignant lesion developed. A majority of the Court of Appeal (Rix and Stanley Burnton LJJ) upheld the judge in relation to some of the EL insurance policies (particularly those covering disease contracted during the relevant insurance period); however they concluded that other policies (particularly those covering disease sustained during the insurance period) responded only on an occurrence or manifestation basis. These appeals to the Supreme Court raise two issues: (i) On the correct construction of the EL policies, is mesothelioma sustained or contracted at the moment when the employee is wrongfully exposed to asbestos or at the moment when the disease subsequently manifests in the employees body? (ii) Does the special rule in Fairchild/Barker apply when determining whether, for the purposes of the EL policies, an employee sustained or contracted mesothelioma during a particular policy period? The Supreme Court dismisses the insurers appeal by a 4 1 majority; Lord Phillips dissenting on the second issue. Lord Mance gives the main judgment. To resolve the meaning of the EL policies it is necessary to avoid over concentration on the meaning of single words or phrases viewed in isolation, and to look at the insurance contracts more generally [19]. Several features point the way to the correct construction. First, the wordings of the policies on their face require the course of employment to be contemporaneous with the sustaining of the injury [20]. Second, the wordings demonstrate a close link between the actual employment undertaken during each period and the premium agreed by the parties for the risks undertaken by the insurers in respect of that period. Third, on the insurers case there is a potential gap in cover as regards employers breaches of duty towards employees in one period which only lead to disease or injury in another later period [24]. Fourth, on the insurers case employers would be vulnerable to any decision by the insurers not to renew the policy. A decision not to renew might arise from the employers complying with their duty to disclose past negligence upon any renewal. Employers who discovered that they had been negligent in the course of past activities in respects that had not yet led to any manifest disease would have such a duty. The insurers could then simply refuse any renewal or further cover [25]. Fifth, the way most of the policies deal with extra territorial issues throws doubt on any suggestion that the wordings are so carefully chosen that a court should stick literally to whatever might be perceived as their natural meaning [28]. Section 1 of the Employers Liability Compulsory Insurance Act 1969 also points the way to the correct interpretation. This states that every employer shall insure, and maintain insuranceagainst liability for bodily injury or disease sustained by his employees, and arising out of and in the course of their employment. In order to give proper effect to the protective purpose of that legislation, the Act requires insurance on a causation basis [47]. There is no difficulty in treating the word contracted as looking to the causation of a disease, rather than its development or manifestation. The word contracted used in conjunction with disease looks to the initiating or causative factor of the disease [49]. While the word sustained may initially appear to refer to the manifestation of an injury, the nature and underlying purpose of the EL insurances is one which looks to the initiation or causation of the accident or disease which injured the employee. Accordingly a disease may properly be said to have been sustained by an employee in the period when it was caused or initiated, even though it only developed or manifested itself later [50]. In relation to the second issue, the question is whether the EL policies cover employers liability for mesothelioma arising under the special rule in Fairchild/Barker [71]. Under that rule the law accepts a weak or broad causal link between the employers negligence and the employees mesothelioma. When construing the EL policies the concept of a disease being caused during the policy period must be interpreted sufficiently flexibly to embrace the role assigned to exposure by the Fairchild/Barker rule [74]. The purpose of the EL policies was to insure the employers against liability to their employees. Once it is held that the employers are liable to the employees, it would be remarkable if the insurers were not liable under the policies [88]. Accordingly, for the purposes of the EL policies, the negligent exposure of an employee to asbestos during the policy period has a sufficient causal link with subsequently arising mesothelioma to trigger the insurers obligation to indemnify the employer [74]. Lord Phillips dissents on the second issue. The special approach developed in Fairchild/Barker raises no implication or fictional assumption as to when mesothelioma is initiated. The consequence is that if claimants have to show that mesothelioma was initiated in a particular policy year in order to establish that insurers are liable they are unable to do so. This conclusion is not affected by section 3 of the Compensation Act 2009, which did not alter the jurisprudential basis of the Fairchild/Barker approach [132] [133]. \n",
            "Prediction: The liability of employers for deaths caused by mesothelioma has pre occupied courts and legislators over recent years. The present appeals concern claims to pass the burden of this liability on to insurers, made either by employers or in the case of insolvent employers by the personal representatives of former employees using the mechanism of the Third Party (Rights against Insurers) Act 1930. The appeals concern employers liability insurance. This is in contrast with Bolton MBC v Municipal Mutual Insurance Ltd [2006] EWCA Civ 50 (2006) 1 WLR 1492 where public liability insurance was in issue. Employers liability focuses necessarily upon the relevant employment relationships and activities. Public liability relates to any of the insureds relationships and to activities affecting the world at large. Another feature of employers liability is that, under the Employers Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 (the ELCIA), it has since 1 January 1972 been compulsory for every employer other than local authorities carrying on any business\n",

            "Target: The Appellant was one of Kazakhstans four systemic banks. The Respondent, Mr Ablyazov, was its chairman and majority shareholder between 2005 and early 2009. In February, Mr Ablyazov fled to England following the Banks nationalisation. The Bank claimed that he had presided over the misappropriation of US$10 billion of the Banks monies for his own personal benefit, and commenced 11 sets of proceedings. It successfully obtained judgments against Mr Ablyazov in four cases, in an aggregate sum of $4.4 billion, and a Freezing Order on 12 November 2009. Mr Ablyazov had entered into four Loan Agreements in 2009 2010. He exercised his right to draw down fully under those Agreements, and directed various payments for legal and corporate services and in relation to a property. The Bank applied for declarations that (on the assumption that the Loan Agreements were valid) Mr Ablyazovs rights to draw down under them were assets for the purposes of the Freezing Order and drawings under them could only be made pursuant to the exceptions at paragraph 9 of the Order. The first instance judge dismissed the application, and the Court of Appeal dismissed the Banks appeal. The issues before the Supreme Court were (1) whether Mr Ablyazovs right to draw down under the Loan Agreements is an asset within the meaning of the Freezing Order, (2) whether the exercise of that right by directing the lender to pay the sum to a third party constitutes disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of the assets, and (3) whether the proceeds of the Loan Agreements were assets within the meaning of the extended definition in paragraph 5 of the Freezing Order, because the Respondent had the power directly or indirectly to dispose of, or deal with [the proceeds] as if they were his own. The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Banks appeal on issue 3, on the basis that the proceeds of the Loan Agreements were assets within the meaning of the extended definition in paragraph 5 of the Freezing Order. Lord Clarke gives the judgment. The only real question is what the Freezing Order in fact made means [16 17]. The Court of Appeal was wrong to have regard to the flexibility principle, which has no role in the exercise of the construction of the Freezing Order as an order of the court. The correct approach to construction is restrictive, not expansive [18 19], and involves consideration of the particular context of the order, including the development of the relevant clauses in freezing injunctions [21 26]. Paragraph 5 of the Order in this case is very similar to paragraph 6 of the Order in JSC BTA Bank v Solodchenko [2010] EWCA Civ 1436. Both differ from the pre 2002 form of Freezing Order, in that they include an extended description of assets in the last two sentences and the words whether the respondent is (or respondents are) interested in them legally, beneficially or otherwise [27]. The courts have approached the language of the forms of Order cautiously, but the scope of Freezing Orders has been gradually extended. In Federal Bank of the Middle East v Hadkinson [2000] 1 WLR 1695, the Court of Appeal recognised that it might in exceptional circumstances be possible to frame an Order so that it froze trust assets, and in Solodchenko the Court of Appeal concluded that this was the effect of the amendments to the first part of paragraph 6 of that Order. The standard form of wording does not prevent the Respondent from borrowing money and spending it [28 30]. In ordinary legal parlance, the choses in action representing the rights under the Loan Agreements would be regarded as assets [31 33]. Context is of particular importance. The Court of Appeal considered Hadkinson and Solodchenko, concluding that the enforcement principle is not absolute and that the right to draw down under the Loan Agreements undoubtedly belonged to the Respondent [35]. These are considerations arising from the wording added to the standard form of Freezing Order. So far as the standard form is concerned, the authorities do not support the proposition that the Respondents right to draw down under the Loan Agreements is an asset within the meaning of Freezing Orders as originally drafted. It is inappropriate to reverse those decisions. The right is not an asset within the meaning of the Freezing Order and the Respondent did not dispose of, deal with or diminish the value of the assets, if the Freezing Order is construed without reference to the extended definition in the second sentence of paragraph 5 [38]. The Banks appeal on issues 1 and 2 is dismissed. But the wording of the Order is different in the more recent forms, used in this case and in Solodchenko. The proceeds of the Loan Agreements are assets within the meaning of the extended definition in paragraph 5 of the Freezing Order in this case [39]. Mr Ablyazovs instruction to the lender to pay the lenders money to a third party was dealing with the lenders assets as if they were his own. It was wrong to dismiss the argument that the Respondent had a power to direct the lender what to do with the funds it was contractually obliged to make available to him. The Loan Agreements contain a binding legal obligation that the proceeds of the facility would be used at the Respondents sole discretion, and a power to direct the lender to transfer the proceeds to any third party [40 42]. The extended definition is not primarily designed to catch assets which the defendant claimed he held on trust. That was the effect of the additional words at the beginning of the clause [43 44]. The last two sentences of paragraph 5 are designed to catch assets over which the Respondent has control, not assets which he owns legally or beneficially. The Respondent had the power to, and did, deal with the assets as if they were his own under clause 1.12 of each agreement [45 50]. The Banks appeal on issue 3 is allowed. \n",
            "Prediction: The Bank has to date entered judgment against the respondent in four cases in an aggregate sum (as stated above) of over US$4.4 billion. No part of these judgments has been paid by the respondent, although small sums (relative to the value of the judgment) have been realised by the receivers appointed by the court. The Bank commenced 11 sets of proceedings in this jurisdiction seeking compensation of about US$6 billion. The Freezing Order includes the following provisions in so far as it relates to the Bank and the respondent: 4. Until judgment or further order the respondent must not, except with the prior written consent of the Banks solicitors a. Remove from England and Wales any of his assets which are in England & Wales up to the Value of 451,130,000 b.

            "Target: The land in dispute was agreed to be sold in favour of the appellant under an agreement. Subsequently, a third party in execution of a decree got the property attached. The sale deed was executed thereafter. A question arose as to the validity of the sale. The High Court held that the sale would be subject to attachment. Allowing the appeal by special leave, the Court, HELD: The agreement for sale creates an obligation attached to the ownership of the property. The attaching creditor is entitled to attach only the right, title and interest of the judgment debtor. Hence, if an agreement for sale is entered into before attachment, the attachment cannot be free from the obligation so incurred, and the attaching creditor will not get any right higher than the judgment debtor had on the date of the attachment. He cannot ignore that obligation and proceed to bring the property to sale as if it remained the absolute property of the judgment debtor. [835C, 834F, 835E] Accordingly, though section 64 CPC is intended to protect the attaching creditor, but if the subsequent conveyance is in pursuance of an agreement for sale which was entered into before the attachment, the contractual obligation arising therefrom must be allowed to prevail over the rights of the attaching creditor. The rights of the attaching creditor shall not be allowed to override the contractual obligation arising from the antecedent agreement for sale of the at tached property.

            "Target: In a Notification dated 28.9.1972, with a view to induce the sugar factories (respondents) to produce more and also to commence their operations early in the sugar year (the year commencing on and with 1st October and ending with the 30th of September of the following year) a rebate was provided. The scheme of the Notification was (1)If during the months of October and November 1972 (in the Sugar Year 1972 73), a factory produced sugar in excess of the quantity of sugar produced by it during the months of October November 1971, suchfactory was granted rebate in the Excise Duty at the rate of rupees forty per quintal in so far as the excess production is concerned. (2)Rebate for the period 1st December 1972 to 30th April, 1973 was available at the rate of rupees twenty per quintal provided the production of sugar during the said period was in excess of 115% of the quantity of sugar produced by the said factory during the corresponding period in the previous Sugar Year, in so far as the excess production is concerned. (3)For the months of May and June 1973 rebate at the rate of rupees twenty per quintal was available provided the factory produced more sugar than it produced during the corresponding months in the previous Sugar Year. The said rebate was available again only with respect to the excess production. 759 (4)For the period commencing from 1st July, 1973 and ending with 30th of September, 1973, rebate was available at the rate of rupees twently per quintal provided the factory produced sugar in excess of the quantity produced during the corresponding period in the previous Sugar Year. This rebate too was confined to the excess production. However, the benefit of the rebate mentioned in any of the clauses aforesaid was not available to a factory which inter alia did not work during the 'base pariod '. The other three Notifications dated 4.10.73, 12.10.74 and 30.9.76 were similar. All the four Notifications were applicable to the Sugar years 1972 73, 1973 74, 1974 75 and 1976 77, respectively. The respondents sugar factories did not produce any sugar in one or the other of the four blocks (mentioned in the Table contained in the Notification) in the base year (previous sugar year). During the current sugar year, they produced certain quantity of sugar during that block period. The respondents contended that they were entitled to the benefit of rebate provided in clause (1) of the Table contained in the Notification, whereas the Revenue submitted that they were not entitled to the benefit of rebate. The claim for rebate made by the respondnets was allowed in the first instance, but later proceedings were initiated to recover back, or re adjust, the benefit already allowed. These disputes were carried to the High Courts. Almost all the High Courts except Karnataka held in favour of the respondents. In Patna High Court, there was a conflict of opinion. Hence this batch of appeals by the Revenue contending that the benefit of rebate was available only where the \"sugar produced in a factory during the period commencing from the 1st day of October, 1972 and ending with the 30th day of November, 1972 which is in excess of the quantity of sugarproduced during the corresponding \"period in 1971\"; that nil production could not be equated to \"the quantity of sugarproduced\" in clause (1); that clause (1) of the first proviso in the 1972 Notification has 760 to be harmonised with the several clauses in the table; and that no interpretation should be adopted which rendered any part of the Notification superfluous. Dismissing all. the civil appeals, except Civil Appeal Nos. 3831 32 of 1988, this Court, HELD : 1.01. The several clauses in the Notification must be read together, harmonised and reasonably understood without ignoring the underlying object and purpose of the notification. An interpretation which leads to absurd consequences should be avoided. [770 E] 1.02.The object behind the notification was evidently not only to induce the factories to produce more sugar but also to induce them to start their production early in the sugar year. The object appears to be also to induce the factories to keep on producing the sugar all the year round, which they may perhaps not have done otherwise. Running the factories during the off season (off season means October November period and then again the period from May June to September), may have its own problems which may increase the cost of production. main issue is whether the words \"the quantity of sugar produced during the corresponding period. \" do not take in the case of a factory which has not produced any sugar whatsoever during the relevant corresponding period? It does take in. Holding otherwise would have this absurd consequence: a factory which has produced, say, just one quintal of sugar during the relevant corresponding period and has produced 1000 quintals during October November, 1972 would qualify for the rebate on 999 quintals while another factory which has not produced any sugar nil production but has produced 1000 quintals during October November, 1972, would not qualify. [770 G H] 1.04.The Idea behind the notification is to induce the manufacturers to produce more in the current sugar year than what they have produced in the previous sugar year or during the previous corresponding period in the previous sugar year, as the case may be. Where a factor; has not produced any sugar or has produced a particular quantity of sugar during the said period in the previous sugar year but produces a larger quantity during the said period in the current sugar year, it must be rewarded. [771 B D] 761 1.05.The case of October November appears to be rather an exception. Normally, it appears, no factory owner commenced the production of sugar in these months because of several unfavorable factors. Indeed, these unfavorable factors appear to be present to a large extent even during the 'months June to September. The notifications were evidently meant to compensate the factory owners for producing during these months as well. 1772 C D] 1.06.One must proceed on the assumption that every industrialist and businessman would, ordinarily, like to produce as much more as possible, since, normally speaking, more production means more profits. [772 E] 1.07.No manufacturer produces sugar merely for the sake of rebate. Rebate is an inducement, an additional attraction. It is not as if without rebate provided by these notifications, no one would have produced sugar. [771 D] 1.08.There is no arithmetical difficulty in working out 115% of zero; it is zero. What applies to clause(1) applies equally to clauses (2), (3) and (4). It is only that the factory need not necessarily have worked during each of the corresponding periods in the base year; it is enough if it has worked in the base year. [771 E F] 1.09.The interpretation placed upon the said notifications by the majority of the High Courts is the correct one. The view taken by the Karnataka High Court in its Judgment under appeal in Civil Appeal Nos. 3831 32 of 1988 and the view taken by the Patna High Court in ill Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No. 865 of 1966 are not correct. basis for the percentages prescribed in the Notification dated 12th October. 1974 the average production of the previous five years and not the excess production. By way of illustrates, take a factory which produces 2500 tons during the period Dec.1, 1974 to Sept. 30, 1975 as against the average production of 1000 tons during the corresponding periods in the five previous sugar years. Out of 2,500 quintals produced during the said period in the current sugar year (December 1, 1974 to September 30, 1975), the average of the corresponding periods of the five previous sugar years ie., 1000 quintals should be deducted first, which means the excess production during the said period during the current year is 1500 quintals. 7.5% of 1000 quintals is 75 quintals. On this quantity 762 of 75 quintals, the rate of rebate as per sub clause (a) will be Rs. per quintal in the case of free sale sugar and Rs. 5 per quintal in the case of levy Sugar. Next 10% of excess production means 100 quintals which would be eligible for rebate under sub clause (b) at the rate of Rs. 40 per quintal In the case of free sale sugar and Rs. 10 per quintal in the case of levy sugar. The next 100 quintals would be eligible for rebate under sub clause (c) at the rate of Rs. 50 per quintal in the case of free sale sugar and Rs. 14 per quintal in the case of levy sugar. Then again the next 100 quintals would be eligible for rebate under sub clause (d) at the rate of Rs. 60 per quintall in the case of free sale sugar and Rs. 18 per quintal in the case of levy sugr. The balance of 1125 quintals would qualify for rebate under sub clause (e) at the rate of Rs. 82 per quintal in the case of free sale sugar and Rs. 22 per quintal in the case of levy sugar.

            "Target: Respondent 1 was the Station House Officer and Respondents 2 to 4 were attached as constables to the Police Station. The prosecution alleged that a complaint was filed against the deceased for cattle trespass. The Respondent pursuant to the said complaint sought to extort illegal gratification from the deceased for hushing up the case. Respondent 2 succeeded in obtaining Rs. 100 and made a further demand of Rs. 200. The deceased refused to oblige him and made a complaint to the Superintendent of Police, who forwarded it to Respondent 1 for inquiry and report. This incensed Respondent 1. The deceased was arrested and brought to the Police Station by Respondents 3 and 4 at about 10.00 A.M. Same day at about 6.00 P.M. the deceased succumbed to injures which were caused to him by Respondents while he was in their custody. The Sessions Court tried the four Respondents, convicted each of them under section 304, Part 2 of the Penal Code while Respondent I was also convicted under section 220 of the Penal Code and all were sentenced to different terms of imprisonment. The Respondents appealed to the High Court and a Single Judge set aside their order of convictions and sentences. Allowing the Appeal of the State, 622 ^ HELD: 1. It is impossible to sustain the judgment of the High Court as it has totally overlooked crucial evidence led by the prosecution and taken an unrealistic view of unequivocal facts. It has not even adverted to the reasons given by the trial court for holding the Respondents guilty of the offences of which they were convicted. [625B C] 2. It is quite clear that upon the evidence led by the prosecution only one conclusion is possible, which is, that the Respondents inflicted injuries upon Brijlal while he was in their custody, thereby causing his death. [635F] 3. It is well settled that, as a matter of law, a dying declaration can be acted upon without corroboration. There is not even a rule of prudence which has harden d into a rule of law that a dying declaration cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated. The primary effort Or the Court has to be to find out whether the dying declaration is true. If it is, no question of corroboration arises. It is only If the circumstances surrounding the dying declaration are not clear or convincing that the Court may, for its assurance, look for corroboration to the dying declaration. [628D E] The instant case. is a typical illustration of that class of cases in which the Court should not hesitate to act on the basis of an uncorroborated dying declaration The circumstances leave no doubt that the dying declaration made by the deceased to the Judicial Magistrate to the effect that he was beaten by Darogah and the constables at the Police Station is true in every respect and it is safe to accept the same. [628F; G; 629A B] Khushal Rao vs The State of Bombay, ; , Harbans Singh vs State of Punjab, [1967] Supp. ISCR 104 and Gopalsingh vs State of M.P, , followed. The distinction between murder and culpable hom cide not amounting to murder is often lost sight of, resulting in undue liberality in favour of undeserving culprits like the respondent police officers Except in cases covered by five exceptions mentioned in section 300 of the Penal Code, culpable homicide is murder if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or if the act falls within any of the three clauses of section 300, namely, 2ndly, 3rdly and 4thly. [630 F G] The instant case, appears to fall under the clause '2ndly ' of section 300 since the act by which the death of was caused, was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the Respondents knew to be likely to cause his death. It is regrettable that the Sessions Court convicted the Respondents under section 304 instead of convicting them under sect on 302 of the Pen 11 Code. This Court, would not however pursue the matter further since the State did not fled an appeal against the judgment of the Sessions Court. [630H; 631A] 5. The record of the case is disproportionately bulky to the narrow Point which is involved in the case. It is not an unusual experience that the wood is missed for the trees when a Judge is confronted with a jumbled up mass of data 623 relevant and irrelevant. it is necessary in such cases to find the central point of the case and to concentrate upon evidence which bears upon that point. Petty details which befog the real issue and contradictions in the evidence which are inevitable when a story is narrated under the stress of a grave crime, ought not to be permitted to tilt the scales of justice. The more a Judge gets bogged down in superfluous details the greater is the likelihood of his straying away from evidence which can clinch the issue. [625C E] R In the instant case, the High Court missed or mistook the salient features of the case and embarked upon a hair splitting exercise while appreciating the evidence. Remand orders are often passed mechanical,y without a proper application of mind. In this case, the Magistrate was led into passing an order of remand on the basis of the usual statement that the offence of which the accused was charged was still under investigation. What is important is that deceased had not committed any offence at all for which 1 could be remanded and, far from being an accused, he was in the position of a complainant. Respondent 1 was the architect of his remand and the motive for obtaining the remand order was to keep him in custody so as to prevent him from disclosing to his people who beat him and where. [627D F] 7. It is necessary that the Government amends the law appropriately so that policemen l who commit atrocities on persons who are in their custody are not allowed to escape by reason of paucity or absence of evidence. Police Officers alone and none else. can give evidence as regards the circumstances in which a person in their custody comes to receive injuries while in their custody. Bound by ties of a kind of brotherhood, they often prefer to remain silent in such situations and when they choose to speak they put their own glass upon facts and pervert the truth. The result is that persons on whom atrocities are perpetrated by the police in the sanctum sanctorum OF the Police Station, are left without evidence to prove who the offenders are. The law as to the burden of proof in such cases may be re examined by the legislature so that hand maids of law and order do not use their authority and opportunities for oppressing the innocent citizens, who look to them for protection.

            "Target: The appellants plaintiffs sought the eviction of the respondents defendants from the suit premises which was leased to the latter for a period of ten years only and for running a hotel, on the grounds (a) of personal requirement to run a hotel business themselves and (b) of the failure of the respondents to deliver possession after the expiry of the period of lease despite notices issued. The Trial Court and the High Court in appeal having dismissed the suit, the appellants obtained special leave of this Court. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD : 1. The Jammu and Kashmir Houses and Shops Rent Control Act, 1966 is a piece of social legislation aimed at easing the problem of accommodation, protecting the tenants from evictions inspired by profit hunting motives and providing certain safeguards for the tenants and saving them from great expense, inconvenience and trouble. But the Act does not completely overlook the interest of the landlord and has under certain conditions granted a clear right to the landlord to seek eviction on proof of the grounds mentioned in section 1. Of the Act. Thus, the Act appears to have struck a just balance between the genuine need of the landlord on the one 'land and great inconvenience and trouble which may be caused to the tenants on the other. In the instant case. the defendants had taken the property on lease only for a period of I O years and now they have been in prossession of the same for over 30 years. If the plaintiffs found that their present business had become dull and was not yielding sufficient income to maintain themselves and therefore, it was necessary to occupy the house so as to run a hotel business, it cannot by any stretch of imagination be said that the plaintiffs had merely a desire rather than a bonafide need for evicting the tenants. The findings of the High court that the plaintiffs had not proved that they had a bonafide need for occupation of the building in dispute is incorrect. [7E H, 8A] 2. Section 11(h) of the Act uses the words 'reasonable requirement ' which undoubtedly postulate that there must be an element of need as opposed to a mere desire or wish. The distinction between desire and need should doubtless be kept in mind but not so as to make even the genuine need as nothing but a desire as the High Court has done in this case. The connotation of the term 'need ' or 'requirement ' should not be artificially extended nor its language so unduly stretched or strained as to make it impossible or extremely difficult for the landlord lo get a decree for eviction. Such a course would defeat the very pur 2 pose of the Act which affords The facility of eviction of the tenant to the landlord on certain specified grounds. 'This is the general scheme of all the Rent Control Acts, prevalent in other States in the country. The word \"requirement\" merely connotes that there should be an element of need. In such cases the main test should be whether it was necessary for the landlords t() need the premises for their own use or occupation. [8A D, F] In the instant case, the plaintiffs had proved that The requirement for the house for starting a hotel business was both genuine and reasonable and even imperative, because the scanty income of the plaintiffs was not sufficient to maintain them or to afford them a decent or comfortable living. [9A B] Phiroze Ramanji Desai vs Chandrakant N. Patel and Ors ; ; applied. B. Baliah v Chandoor Lachaiah, A.I.R. 1965 A.P. 435 (D.B.) approved. The words \"own occupation\" in section ll(h) cannot be so narrowly interpreted as to indicate actual physical possession of the landlord personally and nothing short of that. The provision in section ll(h) of the Act is meant for the benefit of the landlord and, therefore, it must be so construed as to advance the object of the Act. The word 'occupation ' does not exclude the possibility of the landlord starting a business or running a hotel in the shop which also would amount to personal occupation by the landlord. The section contemplates the actual possession of the landlord, whether for his own residence or for his business. It is manifest that even, if the landlord is running a hotel in the house, he is undoubtedly in possession or occupation of the house in the legal sense of the term. Furthermore, the section is wide enough/to include the necessity of not only the landlord but also of the persons who are living with him as members of the same family. [9G H, 10A and D] In the instant case there can be no manner of doubt that the house was required for the personal residence or occupation of all the three plaintiffs who admittedly were the owners of the house. The fact that the plaintiffs wanted to occupy the property for running hotel would not take their case out of the ambit of personal necessity and the occupation of a house may be required by the owner for personal purposes. He may choose to reside himself in the house or run a business in the house or use it as a paying guest house and derive income therefrom. In all these cases even though the owner may not physically reside in the house, the house in law would nevertheless be deemed to be in actual occupation of the owners. [10A C] 4. (a) In deciding the aspect of balance of convenience of the parties in an eviction suit each party has to prove its relative advantages or disadvantages and the entire onus cannot be thrown on the plaintiffs to prove that lesser disadvantages will be suffered by the defendants and that they were remediable. [10H, 11A] (b) It is no doubt true that the tenant will have to be ousted from the house if a decree for eviction is passed, but such an event would happen when ever a decree for eviction is passed and was fully in contemplation of the legislature when section ll(l)(h) of the Act was introduced in the Act. This by itself would not be a valid ground for refusing the plaintiffs a decree for eviction. [10F G] 3 M/s. Central Tobacco Co. vs Chandra Prakash, Civil Appeal No. 1175/69 [SC] dated 23 4 1969 and Phiroze Ramanji Desai vs Chandrakant N. Patel and Ors. [1974] I S.C.C. 661; referred to. Kelley vs Goodwin, [1947] All E.R. P. 810; quoted with approval; K Parasuramaiah v Pokuri Lakshmamma AIR 1965 A.P. 220 approved. (c) Being the owners of the house they cannot be denied eviction and be compelled to live below the poverty line merely to enable the respondents to carry on their flourishing hotel business, at the cost of the appellants. This shows the great prejudice that will be caused to the plaintiffs if their suit is dismissed. The plaintiffs have already produced material before the court to show that their income does not exceed more than Rs. 8000 to Rs. 9000/ per year as the yearly income tax paid by them is Rs. 70 to Rs. 80 only. There is no other means for them to augment their income except to get their own house vacated by the defendants so as to run a hotel business. [12H, 13A B] (d ) on a careful comparison and assessment of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the landlord and the tenant, it is clear that the scale is tilted in favour of the plaintiffs in the instant case. The inconvenience, loss and trouble resulting from denial of a decree for eviction in favour of the plaintiffs far outweigh the prejudice or the inconvenience which will be caused to the defendants. The High Court has unfortunately not weighed the evidence from the point of view. [14H, 15A] Observation: Normally Supreme Court does not interfere with concurrent findings of facts but as the High Court as also the Trial Court have made a legally wrong approach to this ease and have committed a substantial and patent error of law in interpreting the scope and ambit of the words \"reasonable requirement\" and \"own possession\" appearing in section ll(I)(h) of the Act and have thus misapplied the law and overlooked some of the essential features of the evidence, the merits of the case had to be looked into in order to prevent grave and substantial injustice being done to the appellant.

            "Prediction: The plaintiff's suit was a four storeyed building situated at Maisuma Lal Chowk, Srinagar and belonged to one Peer Ali Mohammad, the ancestor of the plaintiffs. On the expiry of the period of the lease, the appellants demanded possession of the building from the respondents and despite certain notices given by the respondents the respondents failed to give possession of it. Hence the suit. The plaintiffs had taken three main grounds in support of their contention for ejectment of the defendants from the suit premises. In the first place, they alleged that they required the building in order to extend their business by running a hotel there themselves; secondly, as the lease had expired by efflux of time, the respondents were legally bound to surrender possession. Thirdly, it was contended that as the plaintiffs required the house for their occupation, such a purpose did not fall within the ambit of section ll(h) of the Act which applied only to such a case where the landlord\n",

The U. P. Agriculturists Relief Act of 1934 having come into force, the decree was subsequently amended by the Civil Judge by reducing the amount and directing that the amount may be paid in 12 annual instalments with the condition that if three instalments were in default the whole amount was to become immediately payable. The amended decree was set aside by the Chief Court in 1938. The decree holder applied for execution, and a sale deed was executed by the Civil Judge in 1939 for the entire decree amount. The Privy Council reversed the decree of the Chief Court and restored the amended decree of the Civil Judge in 1944. The judgment debtor applied for restoration of the properties with mesne profits by way of restitution: Held, confirming the decree of the Chief Court, that, as the judgment debtor bad not obtained any order staying the operation of the amended decree pending the dereeholder 's appeal to the Chief Court he was bound to carry out the terms of the amended decree, and, as the Privy Council had merely restored the amended decree without altering the provisions as to payment by instalments or extending the time for payment by instalments and its decree did not in any way alter the position of the parties as it stood under the amended decree, and, the sale was not in consequence of any error in a decree which was reversed on appeal by the Privy Council, the judgment debtor was not entitled to restitution. Dayal Sardar vs Tari Deshi (I.L.R. and Gansu Ram vs Parvati Kuer (A.I.R. 1941 Pat. 130) approved. 560 The judgment debtor in the above mentioned case applied tinder section 4 of the U. P. Encumbered Estates 'Act, 1934, for administration of his estate in 1936 but the proceedings were quashed by the Board of Revenue in 1938. As no order for stay of execution was obtained, a sale was effected in execution of the decree in February, 1939. The U. P. Encumbered Estates (Amendment) Act, 1939, came into force after the date of the sale and the judgment debtor applied on the 10th October, 1939, foe amending his former application, but it was ultimately decided by the Chief Court that the amendment application of 1939 must be treated as fresh proceedings: Held, confirming the decision of the Chief Court, that as the proceedings which were started in 1936 were quashed by the Board of Revenue in 1938, the sale held in February, 1939, was unaffected by the bar imposed by section 11 of the Act. The order made on the application of the 10th October was an order on a fresh application under section 4 and it had no retrospective effect and could not affect the validity of the sale effected when no application under section 4 was pending. \n",

            "Target: A complaint was filed against seven persons under SS. 409, 465, 467, 471 and 477A of the Indian Penal Code. After examining the complainant summonses were issued to the accused to answer a charge under section 406. 'The trial started as in a warrant case; prosecution witnesses were examined and cross examined and the statements of the accused were recorded, and the Magistrate heard arguments on the question of framing charges. Thereafter, he framed charges under SS. 409 and 465 read with SS. 471 and 477A, and without giving previous intimation of his intention to do so, passed an order committing the appellants to the Court of Sessions. The appellants, contended that the commitment was illegal because the case having begun as a warrant case it was incumbent upon the Magistrate, when he decided to commit the case to the Court of Session, to follow the procedure provided in Ch. XVIII Code of Criminal Procedure, but he failed to comply with the provisions of SS. 208 to 213 of. 737 that Chapter. The complainant urged that even if the provi sions of SS. 208 to 213 had not been complied with no prejudice was caused to the appellants and the commitment could not be( quashed. Held, that the commitment order was illegal as the Magistrate had failed to comply with the provisions of section 208 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The proceedings having begun as in a warrant case, if the Magistrate, at a subsequent stage, was of the view that the case should be committed to the Court of Sessions, he had to act under section 347(1) of the Code and to follow the procedure prescribed for inquiries under Ch. XVIII of the Code. When, in the present case, the Magistrate decided to commit the case, he should have refrained from framing the charge and should have informed the accused of his intention to commit and should have called upon the accused to produce defence evidence, if any. The failure of the Magistrate to intimate his decision to commit to the accused deprived them of the right to produce defence evidence, if any, under section 208. The denial of this right was itself sufficient to cause prejudice to the accused and failure of justice inasmuch as the accused were prevented from leading evidence which might have induced the Magistrate not to frame the charge against them.

The remaining three accused were discharged. There was then a revision petition before the Sessions Judge praying that the order of commitment passed against them be quashed and the main reason advanced in support of this petition was that the learned Magistrate had not observed the mandatory provisions of law laid down in sections 208 to 213 of the Penal Code which were essential for a valid commitment.

            "Target: In a suit for rendition of accounts, the defendant pleaded that accounts, had been settled and he was to get certain money from the plaintiff; that there could be no rendition of accounts; and that if the court concluded that rendition of account was necessary, a decree for the amount which may be found due to the defendant with costs and interest may be passed in favour of the defendant after necessary court fee was realised from the defendant. While no preliminary decree for rendition of accounts had 'been passed, and, in fact, the defendant was .still contending that there could be no rendition of accounts in the suit. the plaintiff applied for withdrawal of the suit. The defendant opposed the withdraw claiming that in a suit of this nature, his position became that of a plaintiff and he became entitled to have the accounting done and to obtain a decree, and the withdrawal after protracted duration was to defeat this right of the defendant. The trial Court allowed the withdrawal, which was upheld by the High Court. In appeal by the defendant, this Court HELD : At the stage of withdrawal of the suit, no vested right in favour of the defendant had come into existence and there was no ground on which the Court could refuse to allow withdrawal of the suit. There is no provision in the Code of Civil Procedure which requires the Court to refuse permission to withdraw the suit in such circumstances and to compel the plaintiff to proceed with it. It is, of course, possible that different considerations may arise where a set off may have been claimed under 0.8, C.P.C., or a counter claim may have been filed,, if permissible by the procedural law applicable to proceedings governing the suit. In the present case, the pleadings did not amount to a claim for set off. Even if it be assumed that the defendant could have claimed a decree for the amount found due to him after rendition of accounts, no such right can possibly be held to exist before the Court passed a preliminary decree for rendition of accounts. In the case of a suit between principal and agent, it is the principal alone who has normally the right to claim rendition of accounts from the agent. The agent cannot ordinarily claim a decree for rendition of accounts from the principal and, in fact, in the suit, the defendant, who was the agent of the respondent, did not claim any rendition of accounts from the plaintiff.

            "Target: The assessee Company, carrying on business of selling timber in India and abroad, entered into contracts in the nature of forest leases with the Government of Burma, under which it was authorised to fell teak trees, convert them into logs, and remove them after payment of royalty. These leases, which were made first in the year 1862, had been continuously renewed from time to time. Clause 27 of the agreement authorised the assessee company even after the expiry of the lease period of 15 years to remove the logs in respect whereof extraction had been completed, upon payment of royalty during the next three years. At the relevant time the assessee company was the owner of fifteen such forest leases. The last of these leases commenced on Ist January 1926 and 31st December, 1940 was the due date of expiry. However, before the expiry of the period, the Second World War started and the Government of Burma extended them until such time as it became possible to resume forest operations. After formation of the Union of Burma, the ownership of the forest leases of the assessee company was taken over by the Government of Burma in 1948 49; a third of the total teak area on June 1, 1948 and the rest on or about June 10, 1949. In terms of an agreement dated 10th June, 1949 between the parties the assessee made over to the Burmese Government its residuary rights under the forest leases together with the non duty paid logs, wherever found, and also all the assets viz. buildings, dwelling houses, etc. pertaining to the forest leases and received 28,847 tons of teak logs in substitution of non duty paid logs, 2,946 tons against depreciable assets and stores and 12,067 tons against livestock. The logs so received by the assessee com 270 pany were sold off by it from time to time in the accounting years 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1952. The Income tax Officer sought to bring these sale proceeds to tax by allocating them amongst the various assessment years. The questions that arose were: (i) whether the realisation in respect of substituted logs was exempt from tax as being a receipt of capital nature, and (ii) whether the sale proceeds in respect of logs received in lieu of depreciable assets, stores and livestock were liable to tax under the Act or were altogether free from liability. The Income tax Officer, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Tribunal held against the assessee. The High Court, however, answered the questions in favour of the assessee. In these appeals by certificate under section 66A(2) of the Income tax Act, 1922 it was contended for the Revenue that the contracts entered into by the assessee company for obtaining its stock in trade in timber were trading contracts, that under cl. 27 of the agreements the assessee had no interest in land as such, it had only a right to collect and take away logs, its stock in trade, and it could not fell any fresh trees, that 28,847 tons of logs received by the assessee under the agreement were in substitution of the logs that it had already cut and had not been able to remove from the forests, merely as a recompense for its rights in the stock in trade, and that the excess realisation in respect of logs received against depreciable assets, stores and livestock were profits and liable to tax under section 10(2)(vii) of the Income tax Act, 1922. For the assessee respondent it was contended that the forest leases constituted the income producing capital assets of the company in which it had invested large funds in building dams, canals, roads, railways, buildings etc., that the forest leases were not ordinary commercial contracts made in the course of carrying on their trade or for the disposal of their products, these related to the whole structure of the assessee 's profit making apparatus, that the consideration for the logs received was the surrender of the residuary rights under the forest leases and acquisition of assets of the business under the take over agreement, that the assessee was prevented from carrying on business upon the nationalisation of forest resources and acquisition of residuary rights and assets pertaining to the forest leases. It was further submitted that the compensation paid to the assessee was the sterilisation of the company 's business and thus a capital receipt, not subject to tax. Dismissing the appeals, the Court, 271 ^ HELD: 1.1. The forest leases constituted capital assets of the assessee. The payments made for cancellation or sterilization of the rights under these leases were, therefore, capital receipts and not liable to tax. [290E] 1.2. Whether in a particular case payments were capital receipts or not depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case. The basic principles are: if there was any capital asset and if there was any payment made for acuisition of that capital asset, such payment would amount to a capital payment in the hands of the payee. Secondly, if any payment was made for sterilization of the very source of profit making apparatus of the assessee, or a capital asset, then that would also amount to a capital receipt in the hands of the recipient. If on the other hand, the leases were merely stock in trade and payments were made for taking over the stock in trade then no question of capital receipt comes. The sum would represent payments of revenue nature or trading receipts. Compensation received for immobilisation, sterilization, destruction or loss, total or partial, of a capital asset would, therefore, be capital receipt. If a sum represented profit in a new form then that would be income but where the agreement related to the structure of assessee 's profit making apparatus and affected the conduct of business, the sums received for cancellation or variation of such agreement would be capital receipt. [286H; 287A D] In the instant case, the forest leases affected the very structure of the operation of the assessee. The compensation received for the cancellation of assessee Company 's activities could not be regarded as an income receipt, nor the legal character of the payment misjudged by the magnitude of the payment.

For levy of a balancing charge under section 10(2)(vii) of the Income tax Act, 1922 it was absolutely necessary that the depreciable 272 assets should have been sold at a price agreed to between the parties. The agreement under which the assessee company received logs by way of compensation in lieu of depreciable assets did not involve any transaction of sale between it and the Union of Burma. The assessee company never paid any money by way of a price in respect of assets delivered to it by the Government. Therefore, the sale proceeds of these logs could not be brought to tax against the assessee company under the second proviso to section 10(2)(vii) of the Income tax Act, 1922. [29 ID F] Commissioner of Income tax vs Motors & General Stores (P) Ltd., , referred to. The logs delivered to the assessee company in respect of the depreciable assets, stores and livestock came into possession of the assessee in consequence of the agreement against surrender of all outstanding or residuary rights of the assessee to the Government. The arrangement was in consequence of nationalisation of forest operations. The fact is that the assessee company did not mix up these logs with any of the stock in trade held by it in its ordinary course of business. The sale proceeds of these logs could not, therefore, be held to have been received by the assessee company on revenue account. Consequently, the excess realisation received over the cost incurred in getting delivery of these logs was not liable to tax under the Act. [29 IG H; 292A C] 4. Nothing was paid by the Government to the assessee company in connection with 1/3rd area of the forest leases taken over from the assessee company. The assessee company had filed a suit in connection with the timber logs and stores taken over by the Government and succeeded in obtaining a decree. The sum awarded in the decree in lieu of the rights which the assessee company had under cl. 27 of the agreement could not, therefore, be taxed. [292F G] 5. Normally in trade, there are two types of capital, one circulating and the other fixed. Fixed capital is what the owner turns to profit by keeping it in his own possession, circulating capital is what he makes profit of by parting with it and letting it change hands. What is capital assets in the hands of one person may be trading assets in the hands of the other. The determining factor is the nature of the trade in which the asset was employed. [287A C] \n",

It was also possible that the appellants might have changed their minds at any place between the place of seizure and the State boundary. The acts of the appellant then would only constitute preparation and not an attempt to commit the offence of export, because, the test for determining whether acts constitute. merely preparation and not an attempt is whether the overt acts already done are such that if the offender changes his mind and does not proceed further, the acts already done would be completely harmless.

            "Prediction: The appellant was driving truck No. P.N.U. 967. The truck was loaded with 75 bags of paddy weighing about 140 maunds. The Transport Company also gave him a letter assuring him that it was an authority for transporting the paddy. But it later transpired that the letter from'Qimat Rai to the Commission agents at Delhi was not a letter of authority. The trial court convicted all the accused'persons and affirmed the conviction of Sawan Ram and Chiranji Lal. The appellants took the matter in revision to the High Court but the revision petition was dismissed on November 4, 1965. It is necessary at this stage to reproduce the relevant provisions of the (Act 10 of 1955). Section 3 (1) is to the effect that if the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices, it\n",

            "Target: (Per majority Krishna Iyer and Desai, JJ.) ^ 1. The only question before the Court is as to when and why shall capital punishment be pronounced on a murderer and why not in other cases, within the confines of the Code. Urgency to the solution is obvious. The overt ambivalence and covert conflict among judges concerning continued resort to the death sentence mirrors the uncertainties and conflicts of values in the community itself. [89G & 90D] 2. Section 302 of the IPC throws little light on when the court shall be the sentence of why the lesser penalty shall be preferred. Since law reflects life, new meanings must permeate the Penal Code. Deprivation of life under our system is too fundamental to be permitted except on the gravest ground and under the strictest scrutiny. [90F: 94C D] 3. To say that discretion of the Judge passing the sentence under section 302 IPC is guided by well recognised principles shifts the issue to what those recognised rules are. The big margin of, subjectivism. a preference for old precedents, theories of modern penology, behavioral emphasis or social antecedents, judicial hubris or human rights perspectives, reverence for outworn social philosophers this plurality of forces plays a part in swining the pendulum of sentencing justice erratically. Until Parliament speaks, this Court cannot be silent. [95; 97G] 4. Executive commutation is no substitute for judicial justice, at best it is administrative policy and at worst pressure based partiality. The criteria for clemency are often different [99C] 5. In so far as section 302 IPC is concerned several attempts had been made to restrict or remove death penalty but never to enlarge its application. Parliamentary pressure has been to cut down death penalty, although the section formally remains the same. In the case of the Criminal Procedure Code the legislative development has shifted the punitive centre of gravity from life taking to life sentence. In other words, the legislative trend seems to be while formerly the rule was to sentence to death a person who is convicted for murder, it is now to impose a lesser sentence for reasons to be recorded in writing. Formerly, capital punishment was to be imposed unless special reasons could be found to justify the lesser sentence. After 1955 courts were left equally free to award either sentence. The 1973 Code has made an an mistakable shift in legislative emphasise under which life imprisonment for murder is the rule and capital sentence the exception for reasons to be stated. [101D:104B C] 79 6. Criminologists all the world over, however, argued that death has decisively lost the battle, and even in our Codes it has shrunk into a weak exception. What are the exceptional cases ? Personal story of an actor in a shocking murder, if considered, may bring tears and soften the sentence. He might have been a tortured child, an ill treated orphan, a jobless man or the convict 's poverty might be responsible for the crime. [106G: 107B] 7. In the post Constitution period section 302 IPC and section 345(3) of the Cr. P.C. have to be read in the humane light of Parts III and IV illumined by the Preamble to the Constitution. In other words the sacrifice of a life sentence is sanctioned only if otherwise public interest and social defence and public order would be smashed irretrievably. Such extraordinary grounds alone constitutionally qualify as special reasons. One stroke of murder hardly qualifies for this drastic requirement, however gruesome the killing may be. The searching question the Judge must put to himself is what is so extra ordinari ly reasonable as to validate the wiping out of life itself and with it the great rights which inhere in him in the totality of facts. [121F; 110E F] 8. The retributive theory has had its day and is no longer valid. Deterrence and reformation are the primary social goals which make deprivation of life and liberty reasonable as penal penacea. [122C] 9. The current ethos, with its strong emphasis on human rights and against death penalty, together with the ancient strains of culture spanning the period from Buddha to Gandhi must ethically inform the concept of social justice which is a paramount principle and cultural paradigm of our Constitution [l22C D] 10. The personal and social, the motivational and physical circumstances, of the criminal are relevant factors in adjudging the penalty as clearly provided for under the Code of 1973. So also the intense suffering already endured by prison torture or agonishing death penalty hanging over head consequent on the legal process. [112D El 11. Although the somewhat obsolescent Mc 'Naughten Rules codified in section 84 of the Penal Code alone are exculpatory, mental imbalances, neurotic upsets and psychic crises may be extenuatory and the sense of diminished responsibility may manifest itself in judicial clemency of commuted life incar ceration. [l22F] 12. The social justice which the Preamble and Part IV (article 38) highlight, as paramount in the governance of the country has a role to mould the sentence. If the murderous operation of a die hard criminal jeopardizes social security in a persistent, planned and perilous fashion then his enjoyment of fundamental rights may be rightly annihilated. One test for imposition of death sentence is to find out whether the murderer offers such a traumatic threat to the survival of social order. Some of the principles are never hang unless society or its members may lose more lives by keeping alive an irredeemable convict. Therefore social justice projected by article 38 colours the concept of reasonableness in article 19 and non arbitrariness in article 14. This complex of articles validates death penalty in limited cases. Maybe train dacoity and bank robbery bandits reaching menacing proportions, economic offenders profit killing in an intentional and organised way, are such categories in a Third World setting. [112D: 114C: 112G] 80 13. Survival of an orderly society without which the extinction of human rights is a probability compels the higher protection of the law to those officers who are charged with the fearless and risky discharge of hazardous duties in strategic situations. Those officers of law, like policemen on duty or soldiers and the like have to perform their functions even in the face of threat of violence, sometimes in conditions of great handicap. If they are killed by designers of murder and the law does not express its strong condemnation in extreme penalisation, justice to those called upon to defend justice may fail. This facet of social justice also may in certain circumstances and at certain stages of societal life demand death sentence. [123D E] 14. Special reasons necessary for imposing death penalty must relate not to the crime as such but to the criminal. [124E] Jagmohan Singh vs State of U.P., ; ; Ediga Annama vs State of A.P., ; ; Sunil Batra vs Delhi Admn.; , at 569 & 572; referred to. Capital punishment in India; The Impact of the Ediga Anamma, by Prof. A. R. Blackshield (July 1977), referred to. Rajendra Prasad 's case: The family to which the appellant and the deceased belonged were on inimical terms. The appellant who was the son of one of the families murder ed the deceased. After some years in the prison, he was released on Gandhi Jayanti day. On return some minor incident ignited his latent feud and he stabbed to death a friend of the opposite family, he was sentenced to death. The second murder is not to be confounded with the persistent potential for murderous attacks by the murderer. This was not a menace to the social order but a specific family feud. Here was not a youth of controllable violent propensities against the community but one whose paranoid preoccupation with a family quarrel goaded him to go the rival. So long as the therapeutic processes are absent from prisons these institutions, for from being the healing hope of society, prove hardening schools to train desperate criminals. Desperate criminal is a convenient description to brand a person. Seldom is the other side of the story exposed to judicial view. There is nothing on record to suggest that the appellant was beyond redemption; nothing on record hints at any such attempt inside the prison. The appellant showed no incurable disposition to violent outbursts against his fellow men. There is therefore, no special reason to hang him. He should be awarded life imprisonment. Kunjukunju 's case: The appellant, a married man with two children, developed illicit sex relations with a fresh girl. In order to win her hand he murdered his wife and two children. There is no evidence to show that he was a desperate hedonist or randy rapist. He is not a social security risk altogether beyond salvage by therapeutic life sentence. Death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment. Dubey 's case: The appellant, a young man, aged about 20, stabbed to death three members of the family with whom his family had a quarrel over partition of 81 property. It is illegal in this case to award capital sentence without considering correctional possibilities inside prison. He was not a murderer born but made by the passion of family quarrel. He could be saved for society with correctional techniques and directed into repentance. A family feud, an altercation, a sudden passion, although attended with extraordinary cruelty, young and malleable age, reasonable prospect of reformation and absence of any conclusive circumstance that the assailant is a habitual murderer or given to chronic violence these catenate of circumstances bearing on the offender call fol the lesser sentence. Sen l. (Dissenting) 1. (a) It is constitutionally and legally impermissible for the Supreme Court while hearing an appeal by special leave under article 136 of the Constitution, on a question of sentence, to restructure section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 or section 354, sub section (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, so as to limit the scope of the sentence of death provided for the offence of murder under section 302. [131F G] (b) The question whether the scope of the death sentence should be curtailed or not, is one for the Parliament to decide. The matter is essentially of political expediency and, as such, it is the concern of statesmen and, therefore, properly the domain of the legislature, not the judiciary. [137E] (c) In an appeal confined to sentence under Article 136 of the Constitution, Supreme Court has not only the power but as well as the duty to interfere if it considers that the appellant should be sentenced 'differently ', that is, to set aside the sentence of death and substitute in its place the sentence of imprisonment for life, where it considers, taking the case as a whole, the sentence of death to be erroneous, excessive or indicative of an improper exercise of discretion; but at the same time, the Court must impose some limitations on itself in the exercise of this broad power. In dealing with a sentence which has been made the subject of an appeal, the Court will interfere with a sentence only where it is 'erroneous in principle '. The question, therefore, in each case is whether there is an 'error of principle ' volved.[134G Hl (d) The Court has the duty to see that on the particular facts and circumstances of each case the punishment fits the crime. Mere compassionate sentiments of a humane feelings cannot be a sufficient reason for not confirming a sentence of death but altering it into a sentence of imprisonment for life. In awarding sentence, the Court must, as it should, concern itself with justice, that is, with unswerving obedience to established law. It is, and must be, also concerned with the probable effect of its sentence both on the general public and the culprit. Judges are not concerned with the morales or ethics of a punishment. It is but their duty to administer the law as it is and not to say what it should be. It is not the intention of the Supreme Court to curtail the scope of the death sentence` under section 302 by a process of judicial construction inspired by the personal views [35B: 137D E] 2. It is also not legally permissible for this Court while hearing an appeal in a particular case where a capital sentence is imposed, to define the expression \"Special reasons\" occurring in sub section (3) of section 354 of the Code, in such 82 virtually has the effect of abolishing the death sentence. [137H] (a) Under section 354, sub section (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the Court is required to state the reasons for a sentence awarded, and in the case of imposition of a sentence of death the Judge has to record \"special reasons\" for imposing death sentence. Punishment for murder as a rule should be life imprisonment and death sentence is only an exception. [l59A] (b) It is neither feasible nor legally permissible for this Court to give a definite connotation to the expression \"special reasons\" occurring in section 354 sub section (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is difficult to put \"special reasons\" in a straight jacket. Each case must depend on its own particular facts. The question of sentence must be left to the discretion of the Sessions Judge trying the accused. Under the present Code, a trial for murder is divided into two stages. There is a bifurcated trial. The first part of the trial is directed solely to the issue of guilt or innocence, and concludes with the finding of the Sessions Judge on that issue. At the end of the trial when he comes to a conclusion of guilt, he has to adjourn the case for hearing the accused on the question of sentence. [159C D] Section 235, sub section (2) of the Code specifically provides for an opportunity of hearing to the accused on the question of sentence after a verdict of guilt is recorded against him. The burden is upon the prosecution to make out a case for imposition of the extreme penalty. Where a sentence of death is passed, the Sessions Judge has to make a reference to the High Court under section 366, sub section (1) of the Code. Under section 367, sub section (1) if the High court thinks a further inquiry should be made into, or additional evedence taken upon, any point bearing upon the guilt or innocence of the convicted person, it may make such inquiry or take such evidence itself, or direct it to be made or taken by the Court of Sessions. In a case submitted under section 366, the High Court under section 368(a) may either confirm the sentence, or pass any other sentence, i.e. reduce the sentence of death into a sentence of imprisonment for life. thereafter an appeal lies to this Court by a special leave under Article 136 on the question of sentence. [159E H] Failing the appeal, there is the President 's power to grant reprieve and pardon under Article 72 (1), as well as the Governor 's power of commutation under Article 161 of the Constitution which is a sovereign function. The power of the President and of the Governor to grant reprieves and pardons is wide enough to include the power to commute and to remit sentence of punishment. All cases of capital punishment are closely scrutinised by the Executive at both the levels to see whether there are such extenuating circumstances as would justify a reprieve, and the power to commute a death sentence is freely exercised, whenever there is some doubt as to the severity of the punishment. Under the present system the Prerogative of Mercy in the case , of persons under sentence of death works well and it produces results gene rally regarded as satisfactory. It helps in mitigating the rigour of the death sentence, particularly in case of those murderers whose execution would offend the public conscience. Very few persons under a sentence of death may be one or two in a year, in a State are usually executed. It is, therefore, not proper for the Court to trench upon the President 's or the Governor 's perogative to grant pardon or reprieve under Articles 72(1) and 161 in taking 83 upon itself the task of commutation of a death sentence, which is properly imposed, in the facts and circumstances of a particular case, merely because there is a doubt that the Executive may commute the sentence ultimately, or by one 's views as to the utility of death penalty. [160A E] Balwant Sing case ; Ambaram 's Case 11974] 4 SCC 298 and Sarveshwar Prasad Sharma 's case 11978] 1 SCR 360; referred to. (c) Judges are entitled to hold their own views, but it is the bounden duty of the Court to impose a proper punishment, depending upon the degree of criminality and the desirability to impose such punishment as a measure of social necessity, as a means of deterring other potential offenders. It is only in very grave cases where it is a crime against the society and the brutality of the crime shocks the judicial conscience that the Court has the power, as well as the duty, to impose the death sentence. In view of these adequate safeguards, it can hardly be asserted that the sentence of death provided for an offence of murder punishable under section 302, is 'dehumanizing ' or that it is 'unnecessary '. Where the crime is cruel and inhuman a death sentence may be called for. [160F H] Ediga Anamma; , ; Bishan Das & Ors. ; referred to. (d) If Parliament thought it right to give to the Judges discretion as to the sentence, they would not or ought not to shrink from their onerous responsibility. It would not be appropriate to curtail the ambit of their discretion by judicial process. A sentence of a wrong type, that is, to substitute a sentence of imprisonment for life where the death sentence is called for, causes grave miscarriage of justice. A sentence or pattern of sentences which fails to take due account of gravity of the offence can seriously undermine respect for law. [164E F] (e) In the three cases there were 'special reasons ' within the meaning of section 354, sub section (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the passing of the death sentence in each and, therefore, the High Courts were justified in confirming the death sentence passed under section 368(a) of the Code. Indeed, they are illustrative of the rate type of cases, that is, first degree murders, where a death sentence is usually awarded in any civilised country. These were cases of diobolical, cold blooded brutal murders of innocent persons, that is, first degree murders of extreme brutality or depravity. The inhumanity of some of the offences defied belief Any interference with the sentence of death, would be wholly unwarranted in each case. [l64G] (f) It is the duty of the Court to impose a proper punishment depending upon the degree of criminality and desirability to impose such punishment as a measure of social necessity as a means of deterring other potential offenders. Failure to impose a death sentence in such grave cases where it is a crime against the society particularly in cases of murders committed with extreme brutality, will bring to nought the sentence of death provided for by section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. To allow the appellants to escape with the lesser punishment after they had committed such intentional, cold blooded deliberate and brutal murders will deprive the law of its effectiveness and result in travesty of justice. [l68A B] 84 (g) In these appeals it cannot be asserted that the award of death sentence to the appellants was \"erroneous in principle\". Nor can it be said that the sentence of death passed on them was arbitrary or excessive or indicative of an improper exercise of discretion. [167H] (i) Rajendra Prasad 's case is destructive of the theory of reformation. The 'therapeutic touch ' which it is said is the best way of preventing repetition of the offence has been of no avail. Punishment must be designed so as to deter, as far as possible from commission of similar offences. It should also serve as a warning to other members of society. In both respects, the experiment of reformation has miserably failed. There is no doubt, with the commutation of his death sentence, the accused will commit a few more murders and he would again become a menace to the community. [165G] (ii) In Kunjukunju Janardhan 's case the accused, who acted as a monster, did not even spare his two innocent minor children in order to get rid of his wife and issues through her. The death sentence was the only and appropriate penalty which should be awarded in such a case. [166D] (h) There is no inexorable rule that either the extreme youth of the accused or the fact that he acted in a heat of passion must always irrespective of the enormity of the offence or otherwise be treated as a sufficient ground for awarding the lesser punishment. The Court has to take into consideration all the circumstances which do not merit the extreme penalty. In the facts and circumstances of this particular case i.e. Sheo Shanker . Dubey 's case these factors cannot outweigh other considerations. Three precious lives have been lost by the dastardly act of the accused. A family has ` been wiped off. The death sentence was clearly called for in this case E firstly, as a threat or warning to deter potential murderers, and secondly as the guarantee against the brutalisation of human nature. All facts and circumstances, constitute 'special reasons ' why the accused should be sentenced to death. [167E Fl 3. It cannot be said that imposition of death penalty, except in the classes of cases indicated in the majority Judgment would be violative of Articles 14,19 and 21 of the Constitution. Such a question really does not arise forconsideration. [136G] (a) The citizen 's right to life and personal liberty are guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution irrespective of his political beliefs, class, creed or religion. The Constitution has, by Article 21 itself forged certain procedural safeguards for protection to the citizen of his life and personal liberty. The idealistic considerations as to the inherent worth and dignity of man is a fundamental and prevasive theme of the Constitution, to guard against the execution of a citizen for his political beliefs. [136C D] (b) A patriot cannot be equated with an ordinary criminal. A humanistic approach should not obscure one 's sense of realities. When a man commits a crime against the society by committing a diabolical, cold blooded, pre planned murder, of an innocent person the brutality of which shocks the conscience of the Court, he must face the consequences of his act. Such a person forfeits his right to life. [136E3] 85 Jagmohan Singh vs State of U.P. ; followed. Furman vs Georgia, ; , 33 L. ed, 2nd 346 explained and differed from. Michael de Freites vs Gaorgie Ramouter Benny, L.R. ; quoted with approval. (c) If the Courts were to be guided by the classification for inflicting death penalty only in the case of three categories of criminals, namely, (i) for white collar offences (ii) for anti social offences, and (iii) for exterminating a person who is a menace to the society, that is, a 'hardened murderer ', the death sentence for an offence of murder punishable under section 302, for all practical purposes would be virtually non existent. Unfortunately our penal laws do not provide for death sentence for either white collar crimes or anti social offences. As regards 'hardened ' murderers, there are few to be found. Many murders unfortunately go undetected and many a brutal murderer has to be acquitted for want of legal evidence bringing his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, when the guilt is proved, the Court should leave aside all humanitarian considerations if the extreme penalty is called for. A 'professional ' murderer must, as matter of course, be sentenced to death because he is menace to the society. Whatever sympathy the Court can have should be reserved for the victims of the crime rather than for the perpatrators. In such cases, the law must take its course. [162B E; 163C D] 4. The criminality of a crime consists not only in the criminal act but in what that signifies. Its immediately apparent features, the obvious damage to person or property or to public security, are symptoms of a deeper disorder. It betokens, and it fosters, an attitude in man to man, of reckless selfishness, decit or malice, which is incompatible in the long run with any decent social life. In any advanced society it is, in part at least, on account of this wider character, less easily discerned, that the graver offence are Punished. [l43E F] (a) All punishment properly implies moral accountability. It is related to injury and not only to damage or danger however greater. Capital punishment does so in an eminent degree. It is directed against one who is ex hypothesi an inhuman brute, i.e. it is imposed simply to eliminate who is held to have become irretrievably, a. Iiability or a menace to society. [142E] (b) Punishment like crime has a dual character. The penalty which the convicted murderer incurs is not simply death, but death in disgrace and death as a disgrace. In so far as capital punishment is a threat, the threat consists not only in death but in infamy. Any theory which ignores this characteristic is certainly defective. [l43F] Sir Walter Moberly The Ethics of Punishment Ch. Xl Capital Punishment pp. 271 81: referred to. (c) Punishment inflicted by the State in response to a violation of criminal law has been justified in various ways namely, as society 's vengeance upon the criminal as atonement by the wrong doer, as a means of deterring other criminals, as protection for the law abiding and as a way of rehabilitating the criminal. 86 Theories of rehabilitation are largely speculative, since there is lack of scientific evidence to support them, though it has been influential in the development of modern penology.[144A B] 5. (a) The capital punishment controversy falls within the strict limits of 'independent ' parliamentary law making, and is a typical or representative of the kind of problems that leaders of Parliament face every day. In short, the case for abolition of the death sentence is political, not constitutional, The Government carries the responsibility of law and order. That is the first` and fundamental duty of any Government. The Executive has the duty of advising the Government of the laws it believes necessary for the national wellbeing. It is the duty of the Court, including this Court, to administer the laws as they are. [l57D E] (b) Analysing the substantive merits of the cases for and against the death penalty for murder is essentially a question for the Parliament to resolve and not for the Supreme Court to decide. Therefore, it would not be proper for the Judges to attempt to project their personal views in a matter which lies in the realm of political decision making, by focussing on a single controversy, the question of the proper penalty for the crime of murder. [157B] (c) Any justification for the capital sentence, as for other salient features of the penal system must be sought in the protection of the society and that alone. [145E] Even where it has been legally retained, as in India, Capital Punishment is now seldom employed except in very grave cases where it is a crime against the society and the brutality of the crime shocks the judicial conscience. Indeed the death penalty satisfies the society 's retributive goals and is still presumed to be a deterrent to potential offenders Of the three purposes commonly assigned to punishment retribution, deterrence and reformation deterrence is generally held to be the most important, although the continuing public demand for retribution cannot be ignored. Prima facie, the death sentence is likely to have a stronger affect as a deterrent upon normal human beings than any other form of punishment. People are believed to refrain from crime because they fear punishment. Since people fear death more than anything else, the death penalty is the most effective deterrent. [146C E] (d) If the appeal of capital punishment were merely to fear of death, it would be a very inefficient protector of society. In civilised society and in peace time, government relies for obedience more on its moral prestige than on violent repression of crime. Punishment only protects life effectively if it produces in possible murderers, not only fear of the consequences of committing murder, but a horrified recoil for the thing itself It can only achieve, this, more ambitious, task, if sentence of death is felt to embody society 's strongest condemnation of murder and keenest sense of its intolerable wickedness. It is not by the fear of death but by exciting in the community a sentiment of horror against any particular act, that the offenders could be deterred from committing it. [143B C] Royal Commission on Capital Punishment Para 59: referred to. (e) The punishment of death should reflect adequately the revulsion felt for the gravest of crimes by the great majority of citizens. Legislators and Judges: 87 share this revulsion themselves; otherwise indeed their action would be morally indefensible. Their aim then should be, not only to strike terror nor even to awaken popular indignation in a direction convenient to Government. It would be to arouse in all and sundry their Own indignant repudiation of a wicked act and at the same time, to deepen it in themselves. In this vain sentence of death has been pronounced, carried out and acclaimed with stern satisfaction. Otherwise the conscience of the community would be revolted if the criminals were allowed to live.[145F G] 6.(a) The theory that (i) the death penalty is per se cruel and unusual punishment and (ii) alternatively the inordinate delay in carrying it out makes it so has now been completely destroyed by two recent decisions of the Privy Council.[149F] Eaton Baker v The Queen, Freites vs George Ramouter Benny, ; discussed. (b) ln the United States of America also the death penalty has practically existed more or less harmoniously with humane theories of criminal justice for over two hundred years (e.g). [151E] (i) In Trop vs Dulles, ; , L. ed. 630, the Court refused to consider the death penalty as an indent of the constitutional limit of punishment; (ii) In McGouths vs California, ; , it was held that the absence of any guidelines was not a violation of \"due process\" and (iii) In Furman vs Georgia the multiple opinions did not rule out altogether re imposition of the death penalty in the future provided there was legislative structuring of a permissible system providing for sufficient procedural safeguards; (iv) Later on, the death penalty has been reimposed and this judicial approach stood reoriented. The constitutionality of the death penalty was supported by four factors (1) the reference to capital punishment in the Constitution (ii) the past Supreme Court decisions on the death penalty (iii) the limitations of judicial restraints and (iv) the doctrine of separation of powers. [151F; 152D; 154E] M. Cherif Bassi Owni; Substantive Criminal Law p. 120 128; referred to and (v) In Gregg vs Georgia, ; ; 49 L.ed. 859; Proffit vs Floride, [1976] 428 242; ; 913; Jurek Texas; , ; , 929 all concerned with discretionary sentencing procedures and in Woodson vs North Carolina, ; ; and Roberts vs Lonisiana ; [1976] 428 US 326; both concerned with mandatory death sentence it was held that (a) the punishment of death did not invariably violates the Constitution (b) history and precedent did not support the conclusion that the death sentence was per se violation of 8th and 14th Amendments (c) the evolving standards of decency arguments had been substantially under cut in the last four years because a large segment of the enlightened population regarded the death penalty as appropriate and necessary as seen in the new legislation passed in response to Furman (d) the death penalty was not inherently cruel and unusual. It served two principal social purposes retribution and deterrence, and therefore the death sentence for the crime of murder was (1) not without justification (2) not unconstitutionally severe and (3) not invariably disproportionate to the crime and (e) that Furman mandated, where discretionary sentencing was used, there must be suitable direction and 88 limitation to minimise the risk of wholly and arbitrary and capricious action, the bifurcated trial with standards modelled after the Modern Penal Code juries gave just such guidance. [155F G; 156A] Observation: \n",
            "Prediction: A murder most foul demands of sentencing justice punitive infliction of death or the lesser punishment of life imprisonment, since the Penal Code leaves the critical choice between physical liquidation and life long incarceration to the enlightened conscience and sensitized judgment of the Court. The law reports reveal the impressionistic and unpredictable notes struck by some decisions and the occasional vocabulary of horror and terror, of extenuation and misericordia, used in the sentencing tailpiece of judgments. Therefore, this jurisprudential exploration, within the framework of section 302 I.P.C., has become necessitous, both because the awesome 'either/or'of the Section spells out no ambiguity about the propriety of the impost of capital penalty against which the brutal culprits desparately beseech that their dear life be spared by the Summit Court and the incarceratory alternative be awarded instead. There is, as here, a judicial dimension to the quasi Hamletian dilemma when \"a murder most\n",

            "Target: The appellant has its factory at jamshedpur. It manu factures cast iron sleepers, pipes, etc., in the said factory. The raw materials mainly required for the manufacture of sleepers are pig iron, coke, limestone and moulding sand. The Railway Board is the only buyer of sleepers, and the sleepers are manufactured only on receipt of orders from the said Board and not otherwise. Inspite of its best efforts to secure the raw materials in 1959, the appellant failed to secure the same. As the appellant found that the manufacture of sleepers could not be carried on, it issued a notice and laid off the workers of the sleeper factory. The lay off continued from December 15, 1959 to September 11, 1960. On September 12, 1960, the appellant closed the Sleeper Foundry Department and issued notice of retrenchment. Retrenchment compensation was also paid to the workmen retrenched. The appellant paid the respondents the, statutory compensation for the lay off period as prescribed by section 25C of the . However, the respondents contended that the lay off was not justified, The dispute between the parties was referred for adjudication by the Government of Bihar to the Industrial Tribunal. The Tribunal found that the appellant was in financial difficulties at the relevant time, the appellant was not actuated by any malafide intentions and the lay off was not the result of any ulterior motive. However, it held that if the affairs of the appellant had been better managed and more foresight had been shown by the appellant prior to the time when the crisis was reached, pig iron could have been secured and lay off could have been avoided. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal held that the lay off could not be held to be altogether justified, and awarded compensation to the respondents in excess of the amount fixed by the statute 796 Held, that the lay off was justified as raw materials were not available to the appellant at the relevant time. The only relief to which the workmen were entitled was the statutory relief prescribed by section 25C. If the lay off is malafide in the sense that the employer has deliberately and malaciously brought about a situation where lay off becomes necessary, it is not a lay off which in justified tinder section 2(kkk) and the relief provided under section 25C is not the only relief to which the workmen are en titled. The malafides of the employer in declaring lay off really means that no lay off has in law taken place and a finding as to the malafide of the employer in declaring a layoff takes the lay off out of the definition of section 2(kkk).If lay off is declared in order to victimise workmen or for some, ulterior purpose, the position in the same. \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant laid off the respondents, its workmen, 75% of the consolidated wages as compensation for having laid them off for a period of 45 days commencing from December 1.5, 1959. In August, 1959, the Bhilai Steel Works despatched some wagons of pig iron to the appellant and the appellant used to'pay cash to Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. for the pig iron supplied by it and by a Letter of credit to the Indian Iron and Steel Co., on which the said Company used to supply the raw material made by it. In May, 1959 the appellant arranged for Letter of Credit for a sum of Rs. 1,00,000,000. In November, 1959 both the companies 798 stopped supply of the raw materials in spite of the order issued in that behalf by the Controller. Correspondence followed between the said companies, the appellant was informed by the said company that they could not supply its requirements of raw material. The\n",

            "Target: The appellant published in his paper, which had a circulation mainly in Aligarh, a statement to the effect that Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors had been receiving bribes. The Public Prosecutor and the 11 Assistant Public Prosecutors at Aligarh obtained the sanction of the State Government as required under section 198B(c) of Code of Criminal Procedure to file a complaint under section 500 Indian Penal Code in a court of Sessions against the appellant for publishing defamatory remarks against the Assistant Public Prosecutor S, of District Aligarh and other police prosecuting staff of the Government in respect of their conduct in the discharge of public functions. The Sessions Judge convicted the appellant and the High Court dismissed his appeal against the conviction. It was contended on behalf of the appellant, inter alia, that the sanction granted under section 198B(c) was not the sanction contemplated by law because it was a general sanction and not with respect to the defamation of any particular Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public Prosecutor; for the purpose of an offence under section 500 Indian Penal Code the person defamed must be an individual or a particular group and there was no evidence that the remarks were defamatory of any particular group; that the prosecution did not lead any evidence to establish that the defamed group had any reputation which could be harmed; and that in any event the remarks were for public good. HELD : (i) the sanction given by the Government was specifically with respect to the defamation of S, the Assistant Public Prosecutor, Aligarh, and the other prosecuting staff of the Government and as such it could not be considered a general sanction not contemplated by law. [826 H] The sanction given, could be taken to be sanction in respect of the defamation of the entire Prosecution staff in the State; there was therefore no force in the contention that the Public Prosecutor Was not competent to restrict his complaint to the defamation of S, and other Public Prosecuting staff of the State Government at Aligarh. Furthermore, although the impugned article did not contain any express reference to the prosecuting staff at Aligarh, the offending remarks could properly be taken to refer to the prosecuting staff at Aligarh in the context of the paper being a local weekly and the other circumstances of the case. [827 C E] (ii) Explanation II to section 499 makes it clear that there can be a defamation of an individual person and also of a 'collection of persons '. Such a collection of persons must be identifiable in the sense, that one could with cartainty say that the particular group had been defamed as dis tinguished from the rest of the community. The prosecuting staff of Aligarh, and even the prosecuting staff in the State of U.P. would be such an identifiable group or 'collection of persons '. [827 G H; 828 A C] Supp/. 65 6 824 (iii) The impugned remarks were per se defamatory of the group of persons referred to. The tenor of the article did not indicate that the purpose of the appellant in publishing these remarks was \"public good\". No enquiry could have been started by that Government on such a publication implying the acceptance of bribes by the prosecuting staff. The impugned remarks could lead readers to believe or suspect that the Public Prosecutors were corrupt and thus affected the reputation of the prosecuting staff adversely. Unless proved otherwise, the presumption is that every person has a good reputation. [828 E H] The lower courts were therefore right in rejecting the contention that the impugned remarks were protected under Exceptions 3 and 9 to section 499 I.P.C. and in convicting the appellant.

            "Prediction: The appellant filed a complaint under section 500 I.P.C. against the Editor and Publisher of the Newspaper 'Kaliyug'of District Aligarh, under the heading \"Ultra Chor Kotwal Ko Dante'in its issue dated September 12, 1960 containing defamatory remarks against the Assistant Public Prosecutor and other police prosecuting staff of the Government in respect of their conduct in the discharge of public functions. The Public Prosecutor filed the complaint in the Court of Session under section 198B(c) of the Code of 825 Criminal Procedure, praying for the summoning of the accused and for his trial according to law for the offence.

            "Target: The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is the successor in title to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). In April 2008 the OFT identified 13 parties, including the respondents, as having infringed the Competition Act 1998. In early June 2008 both respondents, along with four other parties, entered into Early Resolution Agreements (ERAs) with the OFT. The ERAs involved the parties admitting infringement and co operating with the OFT in exchange for substantial reductions in the anticipated penalties. A party to an ERA could also appeal against that final decision, notwithstanding the admissions in the ERA, but in that case was liable to have his penalty increased by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). The Early Resolution process was neither subject to statutory rules nor, at the material time, described in any published document. An internal OFT document nonetheless emphasised Fairness, transparency and consistency as integral to an effective settlement process. An OFT speaking note for use in discussions with parties also included a commitment to equal treatment principles. TM Retail (TMR) was one of the parties which had entered into an ERA. In 2008 the OFT responded to a query from TMR with an assurance that, if it did not appeal, it would get the benefit of any successful appeal made by any of the other parties to the decision. In April 2010 the OFT issued its final decision which made findings of infringement against parties under investigation, including the respondents. Six of those parties appealed to the CAT. Neither the respondents not TMR appealed, but instead chose to pay the reduced penalties imposed in the ERAs. The CAT allowed the appeals of all six appellants. TMR then wrote to the OFT, citing the 2008 assurance and inviting the OFT to withdraw the decision against it. The OFT reached a settlement agreement with TMR whereby the penalty which had been imposed on TMR was repaid with a contribution to interest. The respondents invited the OFT to withdraw the decisions against them, arguing that they should also be given the benefit of the assurances given to TMR. The OFT refused. The respondents ultimately brought judicial review claims. These failed in the High Court but succeeded in the Court of Appeal, which held that the OFTs failure to repay the penalties to the respondents was, in the absence of some objective justification for the difference in treatment compared to TMR, a breach of a public law duty to treat all those under investigation equally. The CMA appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Carnwath gives the lead judgment, with which the other Justices agree. Lord Sumption and Lord Briggs give concurring judgments. Domestic administrative law does not recognise a distinct principle of equal treatment. Consistency is a generally desirable objective, but not an absolute rule [24]. In this case the OFT was applying a single set of legal and policy criteria to a limited group of parties within a single area of business activity, and its commitment to equal treatment had been expressed in terms to those parties. To that extent, they had a legitimate expectation of equal treatment; but that tells one nothing about the legal consequences of such an expectation [29 30]. Although procedural unfairness or impropriety is a well established ground of judicial review, substantive unfairness as such is not. the case law add nothing to the ordinary principles of judicial review by which this case must be judged [31 42]. Even accepting that there was a breach of a legitimate expectation in the failure to replicate the assurances given to TMR in 2008, that would not in itself provide a basis for financial remedy in relation to the events of 2012, nor the reversal of financial penalties which had by then been lawfully imposed on, and accepted by, the respondents. It makes no difference to the result whether one applies a test of objective justification or one of rationality [43]. All those who entered ERAs knew of the possibility that other parties would appeal successfully. That was a risk the respondents took knowingly. TMR did not. TMR sought and obtained an assurance on which it claimed to have relied. In 2012 the OFT could reasonably take the view that, if the assurance were not honoured, TMR would have had a strong case for permission to appeal to the CAT out of time, whereas the respondents did not. If objective justification were needed for OFT taking a different approach to TMR, that was sufficient. [44 45]. Lord Sumption adds that the assurance given to TMR was a mistake because it was inconsistent with the OFTs policy of non discrimination, the terms of the ERA under discussion, and the purpose of the Early Resolution procedure [51 52]. That, however, cannot affect the position of the respondents, each of whom had entered into a distinct ERA which was intended finally to resolve the issues which were the subject of the CAT appeals, subject only to their right to either (i) terminate the ERA before the final OFT decision or (ii) appeal to the CAT after that decision. They invoked neither option, thus accepting the risk that they would not benefit from any other partys successful appeal but ensuring that they would retain the benefit of the discounted sanction if the appeals failed. Finality and certainty required that they should live with the consequences [53]. The assurance to TMR was in no sense given at their expense. They had no right to such an assurance. The OFTs mistake was that they gave the assurance to TMR, not that they failed to give it to the respondents. It was not irrational for the OFT in 2012 to repay the penalty to TMR after the appeal while not repaying the respondents, because having failed to appeal in reliance on the assurance, TMR would otherwise have been entitled to obtain leave to appeal out of time. Since they were in materially the same position as the six successful appellants, their appeal would have succeeded. Therefore, while the decision was discriminatory, the discrimination was objectively justified. Unlike TMR, the respondents had no basis for a late appeal to the CAT [54 56]. Lord Briggs adds that, where a public authority has the option to avoid replicating an earlier mistake but at some cost to equal treatment, the choice is one for the authority rather than the court, subject to the usual constrains of lawfulness and rationality. The OFTs conduct did not transgress those boundaries. The circumstances amount to a powerful objective justification for the unequal treatment: (i) the assurance to TMR was a mistake, (ii) its withdrawal in 2012 likely would have left TMR even better off than if the assurance were honoured, and (iii) the respondents had neither received nor relied upon any similar assurance. On any view the OFT made a rational choice between unpalatable alternatives, with which the court should not interfere [62 63]. \n",
            "Prediction: This appeal is concerned with the extent and consequences of duties of equal treatment or fairness, said to have been owed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to those subject to investigation under the Competition Act 1998 (the Act). Since the events in question the OFT has been replaced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), but it will be convenient in this judgment to refer throughout to the OfT. The facts The investigation In March 2003 the OFt began an investigation into alleged price-fixing arrangements in the tobacco market, contrary to section 2(1) of the Act. On 24 April 2008, it issued a Statement of Objections (SO) under section 31(1), addressed to 13 parties, including two manufacturers and 11 retailers. The letters accompanying the SOs sent to the parties in April 2008 had offered the possibility of obtaining a reduction in the financial penalty through co- operation with the OFTs investigation.

            "Target: The appellants, who were manufacturers of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol challenged the constitutional validity in their writ petitions under article 226 of the Constitution of the provisions of sections 12A, 12B, 14(e) and (f ), 56A and section 68A of the Kerala Abkari Act, 1967 (Act No. X of 1967) and Rules 13 and 16 of the Kerala Rectified Spirit Rules, 1973 and rr. 5, 6 and 7 of the Kerala Spiritious Preparations Rules, 1969 on the ground that the State Legislature had no power to enact a law relating to medicinal and toilet preparations as the topic of the legislation was within the exclusive domain of Parliament under Entry 84, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and also on the ground that they were violative of article 19(1) (g) read with article 301 of the Constitution. The High Court dismissed the writ petition holding that there was no conflict between the impugned provisions and the Central law, i.e., the or the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Rules, 1956 framed thereunder as they dealt with different subjects. The High Court further held that the impugned provisions do not offend against article 19(1) (g) or article 301 of the Constitution. In the appeal and the special leave petition to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants (t) The State Legislature had no legislative competence 520 to enact the impugned provisions because the field was occupied by the provisions of The (The Central Act) and the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Rules, 1956 (the Central Rules), and alternatively, the impugned provisions are violative of the fundamental right guaranteed in article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution. (2) \"Drugs and Pharmaceuticals\" having been declared by Parliament under section 2 of the Industries Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 to be a scheduled industry, being item 22 of the First Schedule thereof, the power of the State Legislature to make a law in respect of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol was taken away. (3) The provisions made in section 14(e) of the Act for the collection of supervisory charges was clearly invalid in as much as (a) they are in conflict with r. 45 of the Central Rules, and (b) they could not be sustained as a fee as there was no quid pro quo. (4) Rule 13 of the Kerala Rectified Spirit Rules, 1972, providing for the levy of excise duty as excess wastage of alcohol in the manufacture of medicinal and toilet preparations cannot be supported in terms of the charging provision contained in section 17 of the Act. (S) The power to restrict the quantity of ayurvedic asavas and arishtas in which alcohol is self generated in the process of manufacture having regard to the total requirement of such medicinal preparations for consumption or use in the State is an unreasonable restriction on The fundamental right to carry on trade or business guaranteed under An. 19(1) (g) and was also violative of article 301 as there was demand for such medicinal preparations not only in The Slate but throughout the country. Dismissing The Appeal and Special Leave Petition, ^ HELD: (l) The Central and State Acts operate in two separate and distinct fields and are not in conflict with each other. While the main purpose of the impugned Act is to consolidate the law relating to manufacture, sale and possession of intoxicating liquors and intoxicating drugs, a subject which falls under Entry 8 of List II of the Seventh Schedule, the main object of the Central Act is lo provide for the levy and collection of duties of excise on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol falling under Entry 84 List I. [536 G F] 2(i). The enactment of the by Parliament under Entry 84, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, or the framing of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Rules, 1956 by the Central Government in exercise of their rule making power under section 19 of the Act, for the purpose of levying duties of excise on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol etc., do not pre vent the State Legislature from making a law under Entry 8, List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution with respect to 'intoxicating liquors ' or a law under Entry 51 List II for levying excise duties on alcoholic requirements for human consumption. [528 C D] (ii) It is the charging section which gives the true index to the real character of a tax. The nature of the machinery by which the tax is to be assessed is not of assistance, except in so far as it may throw light on the general character of the tax. The charging section in section 3 of the Central Act clearly shows that it does not seek to levy a duty of excise on alcohol liquor for human consumption falling within Entry 51 List II of the Seventh Schedule, but to levy a duty of 521 excise on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol etc. The topic of legislation under Entry 84, List I of the Seventh Schedule is 'duties of excise on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol etc. The Central Act must in pith and substance, be attributed to Entry 84, List. [532 C E] (iii) The Central and the State Legislations operate on two different and distinct fields. The Central Rules, to some extent, trench upon the field reserved to the State Legislature, but that is merely incidental to the main purpose, that is, to levy duties of excise on medicinal and toilet preparation containing alcohol. Some of the impugned provisions may be almost similar to some of the provisions of the Central Rules, but that does not imply that the State Legislature had no competence to enact the provisions. The State Legislation is confined to 'intoxicating liquor ', that is, to ensure proper utilisation of rectified spirit in the manufacture of medicinal and toilet preparations and, therefore, within the powers granted to the State Legislature under Entry 8, List II. It further seeks to regulate the manufacture of bona fide medicinal preparations and prevent misuse of rectified spirit in the manufacture of spurious medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol capable of being used as ordinary alcoholic beverages. [532 F 533 A] (iv) The enumeration of 'intoxicating liqour ' in Entry 8, List II, confers exclusive power to the State to legislate in respect of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol. [533 B] (v) In matters of seeming conflict or encroachment of jurisdictions, what is more important is the true nature and character of the legislation. A necessary corollary of the doctrine of pith and substance is that once it is found that in pith and substance the impugned Act is a law on a permitted field, any incidental encroachment on a forbidden field does not affect the competence of the legislature to enact the law. [534 B C] Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee and Ors. vs Bank of Commerce Ltd. Khulna A.I.R. 1947 PC 60 at 65 and State of Bombay vs F. N. Balsara ; at 694 5 referred to. (vi) There can be no doubt that the impugned Act is relatable to Entry 8, List II of the Seventh Schedule. [536 A] (vii) When the frame work of the two enactments is examined, it would be apparent that the Central and the State Legislature operate in two different and distinct fields. In the matter of making rules or detailed provisions to achieve the object and purpose of a legislation, there may be some provisions seemingly overlapping or encroaching upon the forbidden field, but that does not warrant the striking down of the impugned Act as ultra vires the State Legislature. [536 G 537 A] Hyderabad Chemical and Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. vs State of Andhra Pradesh and Ors. ; distinguished. (viii) No citizen has any fundamental right guaranteed under article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution to carry on trade in any noxious and dangerous goods like intoxicating drugs or intoxicating liquors, The power to legislate with regard to intoxicating liqour carries with it the power to regulate the manufacture, sale and possession of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol, not for the 522 purpose of interfering with the right of citizens in the matter of consumption or use for bonafide medicinal and toilet preparations, but for preventing intoxicating liquors from being passed on under the guise of medicinal and toilet 'preparations. It was within the competence of the State Legislature to prevent the noxious use of such preparations i.e. their use as a substitute for alcoholic beverages. [537B D] In the instant case the provisions have been enacted to ensure that rectified spirit is not misused under the pretext of being used for medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol. Such regulation is a necessary concomitant of the police power of the State to regulate such trade or business which is inherently dangerous to public health. [537 E] (ix) All that the provisions of sections 12A and 12B ordain is that the Commissioner \"shall have due regard to the total requirement of such medicinal preparations for consumption or use in the State\". The Commissioner has, therefore, only to take into account the total requirements within the State as an element which should enter the assessment and no more. As a necessary corollary, it follows that in fixing the quantity of medicinal and toilet preparations to which alcohol is added or in which it is self generated, normally the Commissioner shall have regard to larger requirements of the manufacture, if the manufactured product has a market outside the State. The restrictions imposed by section 12B as to the alcoholic content of medicinal and toilet preparations and the requirement that they shall not be manufactured except and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence granted by him, are nothing but reasonable restrictions within the meaning of article 19(6). The impugned provisions, therefore, cannot be struck down as offending article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution. [538 E 539 B] 3. The State Act, in pith and substance, is not a legislation under Entry 24, List 11 and, therefore, the question does not arise. [539 E 539 B] 4(i) (a) The provision contained in section 14(e) of the Act is clearly relatable to the State 's power to make a law under Entry read with Entry 51(a), List II of the Seventh Schedule. section 14(e) of the Act is valid in so far as it provides that the Commissioner may prescribe the size and nature of the establishment for such supervision and the cost of establishment and other incidental charges in connection with such supervision to be realised from the licensee. There is no warrant for the submission that the framing of such an incidental provision like r. 45(1) of the Central Rules takes away the State 's power to recover supervisory charges from the licensee. [540 B C] (b) 'Fees ' are the amounts paid for a privilege and are not an obligation. Fees are distinguished from taxes in that the chief purpose of a tax is to raise funds for the support of the Government or for a public purpose, while a fee may be charged for the privilege or benefit conferred, or service rendered or to meet the expenses connected therewith. Thus, fees are nothing but payment for some special privilege granted or service rendered. Taxes and taxation are, therefore, distinguishable from various other contributions, charges, or burdens paid or imposed for particular purposes and under particular powers or functions of the Government. It is now increasingly realised that merely because the collections for the services rendered or grant of a privilege or licence, are taken to the Consolidated Fund of the State and are not separately appropriated towards the expenditure for rendering the service is not by itself decisive. It is also increasingly realised that the element of quid pro quo stricto sensu is not 523 always a sine qua non of a fee. It is needless to stress that the element of quid A pro quo is not necessarily absent in every tax, [541 G 542 D] Mahant Shri Jagannath Ramanuj Das vs The State of Orissa ; , Ratilal Panachand Gandhi vs The State of Bombay [1954] SCR 1055, Constitutional Law of India by H.M. Seervai, 2nd Edn. Vol. 2, p. 1252, para 22.39 & Kewal Krishan Puri & Anr. vs State of Punjab & Ors. at 1230 referred to. (ii) In the case of a manufacturer of medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol in a bonded manufactory, the imposition of the cost of establishment under section 14(e) of the Act calculated in accordance with the nature and extent of that establishment could not be said to be an imposition of a duty of excise, but is a price for his franchise to carry on the business. [543 D E] (iii) No one has a fundamental right to the supply of rectified spirit which is an intoxicating liquor. It is upto the State to control and regulate its supply from a distillery or a spirit warehouse in the State under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a licence or permit its import from outside by grant of a privilege and charge a fee for the same. A fee may be charged for the privilege or benefit conferred, or service rendered, or to meet the expenses connected therewith. A fee may be levied to meet the cost of supervision and may be something more. It is in consideration for the privilege, licence or service. The State is undoubtedly entitled to levy excise duty on the rectified spirit issued from a distillery under section 17(f) of the Act read with r. 13 of the Kerala Rectified Spirit Rules, 1972 but it refrained from making any such levy by reason of rule 21 of the Central Rules and has, therefore, by proviso tc) rule 8 allowed a manufacturer of medicinal and toilet preparations to draw rectified spirit from a distillery without payment of duty. It is thus a privilege conferred on the licensee. To claim the privilege he must comply with the conditions prescribed If one of the conditions is the payment of cost of establishment under section 14(e) of the Act read with rule 16(4) of the Central Rules, the manufacturer of such preparations must necessarily bear the burden s the licensee gets services in return in lieu of such payment. [543 G 544 C] 5. Rule 13(2) is nothing but a corollary of rule 13(1). On a combined reading of section 17(f) and rule 8 read with the proviso thereof, no duty is chargeable on alcohol actually used in the manufacture of medicinal and toilet preparations. The Government realised that some margin for wastage should be allowed and, therefore, inserted the proviso to rule 13(2), which provides that the Government may, in consultation with the Drugs Controller and the Chemical Examiner, by notification in the Gazette, permit allowance for wastage occurring during the manufacture. Beyond the permissible limit, the State has the right to levy a duty on excess wastage of alcohol, i.e. on alcohol not accounted for. [548 D F] 6. The restriction imposed by section 12A of the Act as to the quantity of medicinal preparations to be manufactured relate not only to preparations to which alcohol is added but also to medicinal preparations in which alcohol is self generated. There can be no doubt that ayurvedic asavas and aristhas which are capable of being misused as alcoholic beverage and come within the purview of the definition of 'liquor ' contained in section 3(10) of the Act being liquid containing alcohol. The contention that Note to rule 3(1) is an unreasonable restriction on the freedom of trade guaranteed under. Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution has no substance. [549 B D] 524 \n",
            "Prediction: The appellants, by virtue of a licence in Form 25 granted under the, were entitled to the supply of alcohol free of duty for the manufacture of their medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol under r. 21 of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations A (Excise Duties) Rules, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Central Rules '), and r. 8 of the Kerala Rectified Spirit Rules, 1972, and challenged the validity of the impugned provisions mainly on the ground that where such preparation is a medicinal preparation, Commissioner shall, in specifying the quantity of liquor or intoxicating drug have due regard to the total requirement of such preparation for consumption or use in the State.

The Government issued on the 29th October, 1980 a notification for acquisition of the said land under section 4 of the Act which was published in the Government Gazette dated 30th October, 1980. Respondent No. 1 objected to the said notification. Subsequently the Government bled an enquiry under section SA of the Act and, after submitting a report in March 1981, on or about 10th April 1981, the Deputy Collector issued notice to Respondent No. I that enquiry under rule 4 of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules 1963 would be held on the 15th April, 1981 to which the latter filed his objections on merit by his letter dated 4th May, 1981.

[943E F] 2.2 Land Acquisition proceedings begin with the publication of the preliminary notification under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. When the acquisition is for a company the Purpose has to be investigated under section SA (by hearing objections and disposing them) or under section 40 necessarily after the notification under section 4 of the Act. Under section 6 if the Government is satisfied after considering the report, if any, made under section 5A that any particular land was needed for public purposes or for a company a declaration shall be made to that effect subject to certain conditions stipulated therein. Sub rule 4 of Rule 4 of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules 1963 provides that no declaration shall be made by the Appropriate Government under section 6 of the Act unless (i) the appropriate government had consulted the committee and had considered the report submitted under the said rule and the report if any, submitted under section SA of the Act and (ii) further any agreement under section 41 of the Act executed by the Company. To complete the acquisition proceedings notification under section 6 of the Act is required. Section 6 of the Act enjoins that the government has to be satisfied that the land is needed for public purpose or for a company and after declaration is made the acquisition is complete after the award is made and possession of the land is taken when the land vests under section 16 in the government free from encumbrances. Section 4 939 does not require as such this satisfaction of the government. The government might initiate acquisition proceedings \"if it appears\" to the government that land is needed either for public purpose or for a company. That might appear to the government by enquiry aliunde or on a petition or application made by any company. Whether the need is proper or genuine that can be found by the government subsequently after notice under section 4 of the Act. An enquiry under rule 4 might be made before issuance of the notification under section 4 of the Act but it is not a sine qua non for the issuance of the notification under section 4 to have an enquiry under rule 4 of the Rules. The scheme and the language of the Act and the Rules do not indicate that. Therefore, section 4 as such does not require government to be satisfied, it is sufficient if it appears to the government that land is needed either for public purpose or for a complain. It may so appear to the Government either by independent inquiry or from reports and information received by the government or even from an application by the company concerned. [943H; 944A F] 2.3 It is undoubtedly true that a notification under section 4 can be issued after enquiry under rule 4. But under the scheme of the Act, the converse is not correct, i.e., the enquiry under rule 4 must always precede notification under section 4 of the Act, though enquiry under rule 4(1) must precede action under section 6 of the Act. Further certain matters which are required to be done under rule 4 cannot be done before because the officer or the person authorised by him would have no authority, unless notification under section 4 is issued. [945G H; 946A] Rule 4(4) does not prohibit or forbid issuance of notification under section 4 of the Act unless rule 4(1) has been compiled with. If it is now insisted that there should be no issuance of notification under section 4 of the Act before enquiry under rule 4 then this sub rule has to be re written by stating that no notification under section 4 and no declaration under section 6 issued or made as the case may be unless the requirements mentioned in clauses (i) and (ii) of sub rule (4) of rule 4 have been complied with. On the contrary, it will be contrary to the scheme and purpose of the acquisition proceedings because the compensation for the acquisition has to be fixed under section 23 of the Act keeping the market rate as or the date of F the issuance of the notification under section 4 in view. If it be that the enquiry as contemplated by rule 4 should also precede issuance of notice under section 4 of the Act then that may upset the fixation of the market value and escalation of price with the passage of time between publication of the notification under sections 4 and 6 would make acquisition difficult. [945A.D] 3. In a matter of this nature where several Contentions factual and legal are urged and when there is scope of an appeal from the decisions Of the Court, it is desirable as was observed by the Privy Council long time ago to avoid delay and protraction of litigation that the court should, when dealing with any matter dispose of all the points and not merely rest its decision on one single point.

            "Prediction: The land in question was purchased by Gustavo Ranato da Cruz Pinto hereinafter referred to as the land owner and the original respondent No. 1 on 10th of March, 1978. Subsequently government held enquiry under section 5A of the Act and the Deputy Collector submitted the report to the Government in March, 1981. On 15th April, 1981, the Government issued an application under Chapter 7 of the Land Acquisition (Companies) Rules, 1963 (hereinafter called the Rules) for the acquisition of the said properties. On 26th October, 1983, agreement was executed between the government and the acquiring company that the land was needed for the purpose of development of tourism. the government issued notification under section 6 of the.

            "Target: The European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive 2014/59/EU (EBRRD) amended Directive 2001/24/EC on the Reorganisation and Winding up of Credit Institutions (the Reorganisation Directive), so as to require member states to confer on their domestic Resolution Authorities certain tools for reconstructing failing credit institutions. One of the tools was the bridge institution tool, which required designated national Resolution Authorities to have the power to transfer to a bridge institution any assets, rights or liabilities of a failing credit institution. The Appellants are the assignees of the rights of Oak Finance Luxembourg SA (Oak). In June 2014, Oak entered into a facility agreement with a Portuguese bank, Banco Esprito Santo SA (BES), under which it agreed to lend BES approximately $835m (the Oak liability). The facility agreement was governed by English law and provided for the English courts to have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute. The entire loan was advanced on 3 July 2014. BES made one scheduled payment of approximately $53m, but it shortly became clear that BES was in serious financial difficulties. The Central Bank of Portugal, which is the designated Resolution Authority for Portugal for the purposes of the EBRRD, decided to invoke the bridge institution tool to protect depositors funds in BES. By a decision dated 3 August 2014 (the August decision), it incorporated the Respondent (Novo Banco) to serve as the bridge institution and transferred specified assets and liabilities of BES to it, purportedly including the Oak liability. Under article 145H(2) of the Portuguese Banking Law, however, no liability could be transferred to a bridge institution if it was owed to an entity holding more than 2% of the original credit institutions share capital. By a decision dated 22 December 2014 (the December decision), the Central Bank determined that the Oak liability had never been transferred to Novo Banco, as it fell within the article 145H(2) prohibition. There are ongoing administrative law proceedings in Portugal in which the Appellants challenge the December decision, which have not yet been resolved. The Appellants commenced an action in the English courts for sums due in respect of the Oak loan, on the basis that the Oak liability had been transferred to Novo Banco by the August decision, and that Novo Banco was bound by the jurisdiction clause in the facility agreement. Novo Banco countered that the December decision conclusively determined that the liability had not been transferred to it. At first instance, relying on article 66 EBRRD, the judge found that the Oak liability had been transferred to Novo Banco by the August decision and that Novo Banco became party to the jurisdiction clause. The Court of Appeal allowed Novo Bancos appeal. Relying instead on article 3 of the Reorganisation Directive, it held that an English court was bound to recognise the effect of the December decision as a matter of Portuguese law, which was to determine conclusively that the Oak liability had not been transferred. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Sumption gives the lead judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees. An English court is required by article 3 of the Recognition Directive to recognise the December decision, and must therefore treat the Oak liability as never having been transferred to Novo Banco. Novo Banco was therefore never party to the jurisdiction clause in the facility agreement. The provision which is primarily relevant to this appeal is article 3 of the Reorganisation Directive, which determines the applicable law to be applied to a reorganisation measure in England. Article 66 of the EBRRD is a more specific provision which concerns enforcement [22]. Lord Sumption makes two points about the Reorganisation Directive, particularly article 3. First, its purpose is to ensure that all assets and liabilities of the institution, regardless of the country in which they are situated, are dealt with in a single process in the home member state. This can be achieved only by taking the process as a whole and applying the legal effects attaching to it under the law of the home state in every other member state. It is not consistent with the language or the purpose of article 3 that an administrative act such as the December decision, which affects the operation of a reorganisation measure under the law of the home state, should have legal consequences as regards a credit institutions debts which are recognised in the home state but not in other member states. [24 26]. Second, article 3 does not only give effect to reorganisation measures throughout the Union, but requires them to be applied in accordance with the laws, regulations and procedures applicable in the home member state, unless otherwise provided in this Directive, and to be fully effective in accordance with the legislation of that member state. In this legal scheme, it cannot make sense for the courts of another member state to give effect to a reorganisation measure but not to other provisions of the law of the home state affecting its operation [27]. For these reasons, Lord Sumption rejects the proposition that the effect of the August decision can be recognised without regard to the December decision. It does not matter what the correct analysis of the December decision is, provided that it is accepted (as it is) that unless and until it is set aside, it is conclusive as a matter of Portuguese law that the Oak liability had never been transferred. It follows from the agreed propositions of Portuguese law and from the requirements of article 3(2) of the Reorganisation Directive that an English court must treat the Oak liability as never having been transferred to Novo Banco. Novo Banco was therefore never party to the jurisdiction clause [28]. Lord Sumption also rejects the Appellants alternative case that, even if the December decision is otherwise entitled to recognition in England, it should be disregarded on the ground that it was a provisional decision pending the final decision of a Portuguese administrative court. As a matter of Portuguese law, the December decision is binding in Portuguese law unless and until it is set aside by a Portuguese court [31 33]. Further, no other conclusion would be consistent with the Directives, particularly article 3 of the Reorganisation Directive, which provides that the implementation of a reorganisation measure such as the August decision is a matter for the administrative or judicial authorities of the home state alone, and article 85 of the EBRRD, which provides that an appeal is not to entail any automatic suspension of the challenged decision [34]. There is no basis for a reference to the CJEU, as the relevant propositions of EU law are beyond serious argument [35]. \n",
            "Prediction: The financial crisis of 2007 2008 revealed systemic weaknesses in the European banking system and the lack of an adequate legal framework for rescuing failing banks in some member states of the European Union. The result, after a long period of deliberation, was the European Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive 2014/59/EU (or EBRRD). The directive required member states to confer on their domestic Resolution Authorities (usually the Central Bank) certain minimum powers (or tools) for reconstructing the businesses of failing credit institutions and investment firms. One of the tools was the bridge institution tool, which is dealt with in section 3 (articles 40 41) of the EBRR. This required designated national Resolution Authorities to have the power to transfer to a bridge institution any assets, rights or liabilities of a failing credit institution. The present appeal is about the recognition in the United Kingdom of measures by a foreign Resolution Authority in accordance with its own national legislation implementing the EbrRD.

            "Target: The Government acquired about 500 acres of land from the respondents under the Defence of India Act, 1939, and a settlement was reached in respect of the compensation to be paid for all except about 48 acres of the land. The question of the compensation payable for the remaining land was referred to arbitration under section 19(1)(b) of the Act to be determined in accordance with section 19(1)(e) which entitled the respondents to compensation at the market value of the land. The arbitrator considered various sale deeds produced before him but rejected these and fixed the compensation by capitalising the annual profits from the lands. In an appeal against his award by the respondents under section 19(1)(f) of the Act, the High Court differed from the Arbitrator and enhanced the compensation payable by fixing it on the basis of a sale deed exhibited before the arbitrator. In appeal to the Supreme Court by special leave given to the appellant Collector, it was contended on behalf of the respondents by way of a preliminary objection that no special leave could have been granted by the Court under article 136 as the judgment appealed against % ,as neither that of a court nor of a tribunal; the High Court while acting under section 19(1)(f) was a persona designata and not a court or a tribunal; proceedings before the arbitrator appointed by the Central Government under section 19(1)(b) were arbitration proceedings leading to an award made by him, when the matter was taken up in appeal to the High Court, the appeal proceedings did not cease to be arbitration proceedings and their original character continued so that the decision made by the High Court should also be considered as an award and the High Court considered as having functioned as an arbitrator. Held: (i) While acting under section 19(1)(f), the High Court functions as a 'court ' and not as a designated person. [378E] Hanskumar Kishanchand vs Union of India, ; , disapproved. The High Court of a State is at the apex of a State 's judicial system. It is a court of record and it is difficult to think of a High Court as anything other than a 'court '. No judicial power was ever entrusted to the High Court except as a 'court ' and whenever it decides or determines any dispute that comes before it, it invariably does so as a 'court '. That apart, when section 19(1)(f) specifically says that an appeal against the order of an arbitrator lies to the High Court, there was no justification. for thinking that the legislature 373 said something which it did not mean. Furthermore, neither the Act, nor the rules framed thereunder prescribe any special procedure for the disposal of appeals under section 19(1)(f) and appeals under that provision have to be disposed of in the same manner as other appeals to the High Court according to its own rules of practice and procedure. [375F G. 377B C] Case law referred to. (ii) On the facts, the High Court was not right in determining the compensation payable on the basis of the one sale deed as this could not be considered a contemporaneous transaction; the decision of the High Court must therefore be set aside and the case remitted to that court for disposal according to law after giving the parties an opportunity to adduce fresh evidence.

            "Prediction: Section 19(1)(f) of the Defence of India Act, 1939 empowers the Central Government to appoint as arbitrator a person qualified to be appointed a judge of the High Court. The High Court differed from the arbitrator as to the value to be attached to the sale deeds produced, and fixed the compensation payable on the basis of Exh. A 42 dated 3 4 1951. The arbitrator had fixed the market value of those lands as on the date of acquisition, but in law it was not necessary that the person appointed should have been a District Judge, and that he had not acted as an arbitrator. The Collector of Varanasi filed an appeal before this Court under article 136 of the Constitution, challenging the decision of the District Judge. In appeal to this Court it was contended that no special leave could have been granted by this Court in article 136 as the judgment appealed against was neither that of a court nor of a tribunal.

            "Target: The respondents in the above 13 appeals by Special leave alongwith 2 others filed 15 Writ Petitions in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana challenging. the order dated 28 10 1966 made by the Government of the erstwhile undivided State of Punjab reverting the respondents to their substantive ranks. The respondents were promoted and appointed as S.D.Os. on officiating basis in the Punjab Public Works Department on the various dates between the 1st March, 1956 and 10th May, 1963. The erstwhile State of Punjab was reorganised by the . On 1st November, 1966 the former State of Punjab ceased to exist and the successor States of Punjab, Haryana, Union territory of Chandigarh and the transferred territory came into being. According to section 82 of the every person who immediately before the appointed day was serving in connection with the affairs of the existing State of Punjab would on and from that day provisionally continue to serve in connection with the affairs of the State of Punjab unless he is required by general or special order of the Central Government to serve provisionally in connection with the affairs of any other successor State. Section 83 provides that every person who immediately before the appointed day is holding or discharging the duties of any post or office in connection with the affairs of the existing State of Punjab in any area which on that day falls within any of the successor State shall continue to hold the same post or office in that successor State and shall be deemed on and from that day to have been duly appointed to the post or office by the Government or other appropriate authority in the successor State. Sec 88 provides that the law applicable in the territory will continue to apply after reorganisation unless otherwise provided by a competent legislature. Section 2(g) of the Act defines law as including any enactment, ordinance, regulation, order, by law, rule, scheme, notification or other instrument, having the force of law. The impugned orders of reversion were communicated to the respondents after 1st November, 1966. The orders were passed by the Government in consultation with the Punjab Public Service Commission before 1st November, 1966. The Chief Engineer sent the said orders on 30 10 1966. The orders were however received after 1st November, 1966. Before the learned Single Judge of the High Court. the respondents contended that they were governed by the Punjab Service of Engineers, Buildings and Roads Branch (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules 1942, under which they became automatically confirmed as members of the service and could not be reverted without complying with the provisions of Article 311 of the Constitution. The learned Single Judge allowed the Writ Petitions on that ground. On an appeal before the Divisional Bench by the appellants, the Division Bench divided the respondents into three categories. (1) those who were promoted after 1942 Rules were repealed: (2) those who were promoted within 3 years preceding the repeal of ]942 Rules: and (3) those who were 116 promoted more than three years prior to such repeal. In the case of first category, the High Court held that the 1942 Rules did not apply. In the case of the second category the Division Bench held that they were not entitled to get the benefits of 1942 Rules since they had not completed the period of 3 years probation to acquire the substantive post in accordance with the 1942 Rules. Regarding those respondents who fell in the third category, the Division Bench held that they were promoted in the erstwhile Patiala and East Punjab States where the similar rules did not exist and could not be given the advantage of 1942 Rules. The Division Bench held that Punjab Service of Engineers Class II 1965 Rules were applicable and therefore before the respondents could be absorbed and admitted to Class II service approval of the Public Service Commission was required. In the present case, since the Commission did not find them suitable they had to he reverted to their substantive ranks. On a consideration of large number of authorities the Division Bench came to the conclusion that the reversion of the respondents was not hit by article 311(2) of the Constitution since the reversion was not by way of punishment. The Division Bench, however, held that the impugned orders were communicated to the respondents after 1 11 1966 and hence they remained ineffective and still born by reason of their not having been communicated to the respondents before 1st November, 1966. The Division Bench, therefore, dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants. In appeals by Special leave, the appellants contended that the decision of the Division Bench that the orders of reversion remained ineffective and still born was erroneous. ^ HELD: 1. The Division Bench rightly held that the orders of reversion were not hit by article 311(2) of the Constitution. This aspect of the matter is now clearly covered by the decision of this Court in the case of Shamsher Singh vs The State of Punjab ; This part of the judgment of the Division Bench was not seriously disputed. [120 E F] 2. The impugned orders were not law within the meaning of section 2 (g) and were, therefore not saved by section 88. S.88 was introduced as a matter of abundant caution. The law which was in force before the appointed day in the former State of Punjab were bound to continue until competent Legislature or authority of the successor States effect any change in those laws. If this could be the position in the continuance of the law in the successor States on what principles one can say that the administrative orders made by the erstwhile State of Punjab automatically lapsed and came to an end on and from the appointed day on the coming into existence of the successor States. When there is no change of sovereignty and it is merely an adjustment of territories by the reorganisation of a particular State, the administrative orders made by the Government of the erstwhile State continue to be in force and effective and binding on the successor States until and unless they are modified changed or repudiated by the Governments of the successor States. No other view is possible to be taken. The other view will merely bring about chaos in the administration of the new States. The principles laid down by this Court in following cases: (1) Rajvi Amar Singh v The State of Rajasthan and (2) Rajkumar Narsingh Pratap Singh Deo v State of Orissa and Another ; are not applicable to the present case as this is not a case of absorption of one State in another by succession, conquest, merger or integration. It would be chaotic if these principles were to be applied to the case of reorganization of States in the same country. [123H, 124A D] 4. On the facts and circumstances of this case the successor State far from repudiating or modifying the orders of reversion adopted those orders as their own. The High Court was wrong in holding that the orders were communicated on or after 1st November, 1966 when they were actually received by the 117 officers concerned. Following the judgment of this Court in the case of State of Punjab vs Khemi Ram, A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 214, it was held that the orders were communicated either on 29 10 1966 or surely on 30 10 1966. The judgment of this Court in the case of Bachiter Singh vs The State of Punjab, ; , distinguished. [125A C] 5. It is one thing to say that in the case of dismissal or the like the order becomes effective only after it is received by the officer concerned and a different thing to say that an order has no effect at all before it is communicated in the sense of receipt of the order by the officer concerned. The orders in the present case became effective as soon as they were sent out and for the purpose of section 83 of the Act the respondents must be deemed to be holding the posts to which they were reverted on 1st November, 1966. [125 G H 126A] 6 . About 9 years have passed after the impugned orders of reversion were passed. After the High Court judgement, all the respondents were officiating in the higher posts. After the reversion orders were passed and before the High Court judgment was delivered the respondents were not working in the higher posts. The appellant, therefore, claimed the difference of salary paid to the respondents during this period when they were not working as S.D.Os. The respondents contended that even during this period they were either working as S.D.Os or had gone on leave while continuing in such posts. In the circumstances justice requires that the Government should not claim any refund of any part of the salary paid to the respondents up to date. [126G H, 127A C] \n",
            "Prediction: The respondents in Civil Appeal No. 519 of 1970 and the sole respondent in each of the remaining 12 appeals were the concerned Government servants. Respondents Balbir Singh, Surmukh Singh, Dasaundi Ram and others filed 15 writ petitions to challenge order dated the October 28, 1966 made by the Government of the erstwhile undivided State of Punjab. Their writ petitions were allowed by a learned single Judge of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. The appellants were (1) Government servants and (2) the respondents were Government servants who were appointed by the Union of India on the basis of the orders of the Government.

            "Target: The respondent 's husband was a partner in a firm carrying on business as bankers. He issued a cheque for Rs.3,00,000 in favour of the firm on 4th October, 1952 with a view to give Rs. 1,00,000 to each of his three minor grand nephews. This amount was debited to his account in the firm and credited in the accounts of the three minors in equal proportion. He died on 21st February 1956. The said sum continued to stand in the respective accounts of the three minors in the books of the firm till its dissolution on 4th July, 1960 whereafter some assets were allotted to each one of them in lieu of the amounts standing to their credit. The respondent, as the accountable person, filed an account declaring the value of the assessee 's estate without including the aforesaid sum of Rs. 3,00,000 transferred by the deceased to his three grand nephews. The respondent assessee contended before the Deputy Controller (i) that these transfers were not gifts but amounted to transfer of actionable claims made in conformity with section 130 of the transfer of Property Act by effecting entries in the books of account; and (2) that the transfer amounted to a novation which did not require an instrument signed by the transferor. The Deputy Controller negatived both the contentions and held that the sum of Rs. 3 lakhs was includible in the estate of the deceased that passed on his death. The Appellate Controller confirmed the aforesaid order in appeal. In the further appeal preferred by the respondent, the Appellate Tribunal, held (i) that the plain reading of section 130 showed that the transfer 349 of an actionable claim became complete and effective only upon the execution of an instrument in writing signed by the transferor or by his duly authorised agent; (ii) that the cheque issued by the deceased in favour of the firm only authorised the firm to pay to itself the sum of Rs. 3 lakhs from out of the amount lying at the credit of the deceased but it did not by itself authorise the firm to transfer this amount to anyone else and that such a transfer could be authorised by a separate letter of instructions from the deceased but no such instrument obtained and the oral instructions given could not take the place of such an instrument in writing and, therefore the transfer of Rs. 3 lakhs done in favour of the donees was not in accordance with the requirements of section 130; (iii) that the amount of Rs.3 lakhs was also includible in the estate of the deceased under section 10 of the even if it were assumed that the transfer became complete and effective on the date of the transfer inasmuch as on the facts, it could not be said that the donees retained possession and enjoyment of the gifted amounts to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him and that this position continued to exist till the death of the deceased. The High Court in a reference at the instance of the assessee, set aside the order of the Tribunal on the grounds (i) that it was a gratuitous transfer of an actionable claim and the inter position of a cheque issued by the deceased in favour of the firm made all the difference inasmuch as the transfer of an actionable claim represented by a negotiable instrument like a cheque was governed by section 137 in preference to section 130 of the Transfer of Property Act and that the cheque together with the oral instructions (which even the Tribunal presumed were given by the deceased) would constitute the firm a trustee or an agent holding the moneys for the benefit of the minors and, as such, the transfer to minors was valid, complete and effectual; (ii) that the donor had been completely excluded from the subject matter of the gift and, as such, section 10 was not applicable. Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: 1. The transaction in question clearly fell within the ratio of the decision in Munro 's case and the High Court 350 was right in coming to the conclusion that to such a transaction, section 10 was inapplicable. [362 F G] 2.(i) Section 10 of the prescribes two conditions, namely,: (1) that the donee must bona fide have assumed possession and enjoyment of the property which is the subject matter of the gift to the exclusion of the donor immediately upon the gift; and (2) that the donee must have retained such possession and enjoyment of the property to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise. Both these conditions are cumulative. Unless each of the conditions is satisfied, the property would be liable to estate duty under section 10 of the Act. [357G H; 358 A] 2.(ii) The second part of section 10 has two limbs: the deceased must be entirely excluded (i) from the property; and (ii) from any benefit by contract or otherwise and that the word \"otherwise\" should be construed ejusdem generis and should be interpreted to mean some kind of legal obligation or some transaction enforceable in law or in equity which, though not in the form of a contract, may confer a benefit on the donor. [358 B C] 3.(i) The question whether gifted property should be regarded as a part of the estate of the deceased donor passing on his death for the purpose of section 10 of the Act would depend upon as to what precisely is the subject matter of the gift and whether the gift is of absolute nature or whether it is subject to certain rights. If the gift is made without any reservation or qualification, that is to say, where the gift carries fullest right known to law of exclusive possession and enjoyment, any subsequent enjoyment of the benefit of that property by way of possession or otherwise by the donor would bring the gift within the purview of section 10; but where the gift is subject to some reservation or qualification, that is to say, if the subject matter of the gift is property shorn of certain rights and the possession or enjoyment of some benefit in that property by the donor is referable to those rights i.e. rights shorn of which the property is gifted, then in that case the subject matter of the gift will not be deemed to pass on the death of the deceased donor. In other words, if the deceased donor limits the interest he is parting with and 351 possesses or enjoys some benefit in the property not on account of the interest parted with but because of the interest still retained by him, the interest parted with will not be deemed to be a part of the estate of the deceased donor passing on his death for the purpose of section 10 of the Act. It is these aspects which mark the distinction between the two leading cases, namely Chick 's case and Munro 's case. The decision in chicks 's case falls within the first category while Munro 's case falls within the other category. [358 E H; 359 A B] In the instant case, the donees were never admitted to the benefits of the partnership firm. The Tribunal as well as the High Court found as a fact that when the cheque was issued oral instructions must be presumed to have been given by the deceased to the firm for crediting the three accounts of the three minors without which the firm could not make such credit entries. Therefore, the transaction in question amounted to a gratuitous transfer of an actionable claim to which section 137 in preference to section 130 of the Transfer of Property Act applied and there was a valid gift thereof to the minor donees. Moreover, the amount of Rs. 3 lakhs did not go out of the firm but on being transferred from the account of the deceased to the accounts of the minor donees continued to remain with the firm for being used for the firm 's business; in fact the partnership continued to have the benefit thereof even after the death of the donor till the firm was dissolved. Obviously, the substance of the transaction was that the gift was of an actionable claim of the value of Rs. 3 lakhs out of the donor 's right, title and interest as a whole in the firm and as such was shorn of certain rights in favour of the partnership and therefore, the possession or enjoyment of the benefit retained by the donor as a partner of the firm must be regarded as referable to partnership rights and had nothing to do with the gifted property.

            "Target: Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd (TIGC) has developed a golf resort at Menie Estate and Menie Links, Balmedie, Aberdeenshire. In 2011, Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm Ltd applied for consent under s.36 of the Electricity Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) to construct and operate the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre in Aberdeen Bay. The application concerned the construction of up to 11 wind turbines, which might be of different sizes, with a maximum power generation of 100 MW. The proposed windfarm would be located about 3.5km from the golf resort and would be seen by people at the resort. TIGC opposed the application. In March 2013, the Scottish Ministers granted consent (the Consent) for the development and operation of the windfarm subject to conditions. TIGC challenged the Consent on various grounds in the Scottish courts without success [1]. TIGC appealed to the Supreme Court on two remaining grounds, arguing that the Consent should be quashed: (a) because the Scottish Ministers had no power under the 1989 Act to grant consent to the windfarm application as only the holder of a licence to generate, transmit, or supply electricity granted under s.6, or a person exempted under s.5 from holding such a licence may apply under s.36 (the Section 36 Challenge); and (b) because condition 14 of the Consent, which requires the submission and approval of a design statement, is void for uncertainty (the Condition 14 Challenge) [2]. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal by TIGC. The leading judgment is given by Lord Hodge, with whom Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Reed and Lord Carnwath agree. Lord Mance and Lord Carnwath each give concurring judgments. Section 36 Challenge TIGCs Section 36 Challenge is rejected. It is not supported by the structure and language of the 1989 Act [8 13]. Further, there is nothing in the policy background to the 1989 Act which requires the Court to take a different view of the statutory provisions. There are five reasons for this [14]: (1) The 1989 Act aimed to liberalise the British electricity market by privatisation. The policy did not address who would construct generating stations, and it was not a necessary part of the policy that the persons who built generating stations would also be the persons generating the electricity [15]. (2) The 1989 Act contains two separate regulatory regimes: (a) one for the construction of generation stations and overhead lines, and (b) one for the licensing of electricity supply, including generation. Since devolution, there have been separate regulators for those activities in Scotland [16]. (3) Parliament did not create a regulatory gap by allowing persons who are not subject to environmental duties under para 3(1) of Schedule 9 to apply for construction consents under s.36. The Scottish Ministers have a duty when considering a s.36 application to have regard to environmental matters, and wide powers to impose conditions to protect the environment [17]. (4) There is no need to require a s.36 applicant to hold in advance a generating licence or exemption, as the Scottish Ministers may (pursuant to s.36(5)) include appropriate conditions in a consent [18]. (5) It is established practice in both British jurisdictions for commercial organisations to apply for and obtain s.36 consents before they seek a licence to generate electricity, or an exemption [19]. Condition 14 Challenge The short answer to this challenge is that, even if condition 14 were unenforceable, the Consent would not be invalidated. Condition 7 requires that the development be constructed in accordance with the supplemental environmental information statement (SEIS) which covers important elements of the benefits promoted by condition 14, and the Scottish Ministers can insist on compliance with the SEIS. Further, the scope of the development is defined by Annex 1 of the Consent and the SEIS specifies the maximum size and location of the turbines. Condition 14 is not therefore a fundamental condition determining the scope and nature of the development which, if invalid, would invalidate the Consent [24 26]. Even if condition 14 could not be enforced, a planning condition is only void for uncertainty if it can be given no sensible or ascertainable meaning. This cannot be said for condition 14, which provides that the Scottish Ministers must approve the design statement before the development can begin [27]. Further, condition 14 is not invalid owing to any uncertainty as to what amounts to compliance with its terms. Construing the conditions as a whole (in particular conditions 13 and 24), it is clear that the Consent contains a mechanism enabling the Scottish Ministers to use both the construction method statement and the design statement to regulate the design of the windfarm in the interests of environmental protection, and to require compliance with those statements [28 30]. Given those conclusions, it is unnecessary to consider whether terms could be implied into the Consent [31]. Had it been necessary, however, an inference would have been drawn that the Consent read as a whole required the developer to conform to the design statement [37]. There is not a complete bar on implying terms into planning permissions, and the planning legislation cases relied on by TIGC which suggest otherwise are not directly applicable to conditions under the 1989 Act given the different statutory language [32]. Whether words are implied into a document depends on the interpretation of the express words and, while restraint is required when implying terms into public documents with criminal sanctions, there is no reason for excluding implication altogether [33 36]. Finally, the flexibility conferred on the Scottish Ministers in conditions 7 and 13 to modify the way in which the windfarm is constructed and operated does not invalidate those conditions, as the Scottish Ministers are not able to alter the nature of the approved development [38 39]. Lord Mance provides some comments on the process of implication of terms [41 44]. Lord Carnwath agrees that the planning cases do not assist in this appeal, given the differences between the statutory schemes [67 70], but he provides some guidance on the principles of interpretation derived from them [45]. He considers that the process of interpreting a planning permission does not differ materially from that appropriate to other legal documents and that there is no reason to exclude implication as a technique of interpretation where it is justified [46 66]. \n",
            "Prediction: In 2011 Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm Limited (AOWFL) applied for consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) to construct and operate a windfarm in Aberdeen Bay, off the coast of Blackdog, Aberdeenshire. The application concerned the construction of up to 11 wind turbines, which might be of different sizes, with a maximum power generation of 100MW. AOWFL applied to the Scottish Ministers for consent for the development and operation of the windfarm subject to conditions. The Scottish Ministers granted consent under paragraph 3 of Schedule 9 to the 1989 Act in support of its contention that only the holder of a licence to generate, transmit, supply or participate in the transmission of electricity, which is granted under section 6 of that Act, or a person exempted under section 5 of the Act from holding such a licence, may apply for a construction consent under that sub paragraph.

            "Target: The respondent, who was the landlord under whom the appellant was a tenant, obtained a decree for eviction and damages against the appellant. The respondent filed an execution application on July 19, 1960. In answer to it the appellant flied objections by initiating proceedings under O. 21, r. 2(2) C.P.C. on September 3, 1960. In that application, the appellant alleged that there was a compromise between the parties on July 25, 1957 that in pursuance of the compromise he made various payments and that the last of the payments was made on June 16, 1960, and prayed for recording an adjustment of the decree. The trial court, however, held that as the compromise was entered into on July 25, 1957 the period of limitation for filing the application would start from that date, and since the application was filed beyond 90 days from that date, it was barred by limitation. The trial court dismissed the application on that sole ground, without investigating into the truth of the compromise or the payments. On appeal, the appellate court accepted the contention of the appellant that if he was able to establish that be bad made the last payment on June 16, 1960 the period of limitation of three months for filing an application under O. 21, r. 2 would begin to run only from that date and that his application would be in time. The appellate court therefore set aside the order of the trial court and remanded the proceedings for investigation into facts, namely, whether the compromise and the payments alleged to have been made by the appellant on the basis of the compromise and particularly the payment said to have been made on June 16, 1960, were true. After remand, the trial court accepted the plea of the appellant regarding the truth of the compromise as well as the payments said to have been made by him, including the payment of June 16, 1960, held that the application filed was within time, and ordered 'full adjustment and satisfaction of the decree. On appeal, the findings of the trial court were confirmed and the anneal was dismissed, in second appeal, the High Court accepted the findings on the questions of compromise and payments but held that as the appellant had not claimed to have made the payments in compliance with O. 21, r. 1, C.P.C., as amended and in force in Allahabad, it was not open to the appellant to ask for recording adjustment of the decree, and dismissed the application of the appellant filed under O. 21, r. 2. Allowing the appeal to this Court, HELD: In view of the decision of the appellate court when remanding the matter, it was not open to the respondent to raise the objection ,either of limitation or that the payments had not been made as per O. 21, T. 1, C.P.C. The parties and the courts had proceeded an the basis that 837 the entire question related to a controversy in respect of execution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree. Under section 47(2) C.P.C., the Court has power to treat the said proceeding as a suit. Under O. 41, r. 23, an appellant court has power to remand a proceeding when a suit has been disposed of on a preliminary point; and under O. 43, r. 1 (u) C.P.C. an appeal lies against an order remanding the case where an appeal would lie against the decree of the appellate court. The respondent should have filed an appeal against the order of the remand, and the consequence of his omission to file such an appeal is that under section 105(2), C.P.C., the decision of the appellate court, while remanding the matter, regarding the date from which the period of limitation is to commence, namely June 16, 1960, if payment on that date was established by the appellant, was final and binding on the parties. The High Court when dealing with the matter should have given due effect to the decision given in the order of remand and should have held that the respondent was precluded from raising either the plea of limitation or that it was not open to the appellant to rely upon the payments not made in accordance with O. 21, r. 1, C.P.C., as in force in Allahabad. The High Court had not differed on the concurrent findings recorded on facts in favour of the appellant and therefore, interference with the decision of the two subordinate courts was erroneous in law.

The latter rule required ,that there must be a separate declaration in respect of each transaction whereas the declarations in the present case were in respect of several transactions each. The appellant firm claimed that on the turnover in question it should have been assessed at one Per cent only, as laid down in section 8(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1056. The claim was turned down by the Sales tax Authorities and the Tribunal, but the High Court held that r. 10(1) of the Central Sales Tax (Madras) Rules, 1957 applied only to transactions of purchase by a dealer in the State of Madras and not to the purchasing dealer in the State of Punjab, that the Madras State was incompetent to frame rules governing the conduct of the chasing dealers in the Punjab, and that in any event r. 10(1) was tory and not mandatory. The State appealed. HELD: (i) Ex facie r. 10(1) imposes no obligation upon a dealer in the State of Madras wishing to sell goods : It applies to a clear wishing to purchase goods from another dealer.

The High Court allowed the petition and declared the appellant 's election to be void holding that the result of the election in so Tar as it concerned the returned candi date was materially affected by violation of Rule 10(5) of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. Before this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appel lant that 922 (i) the appellant did not receive any notice of the election petition against her and the trial had proceeded ex parte; (ii) there was no breach of section 30(d) of the Representa tion of the People Act Inasmuch as the minimum 20 days time was available after the date of withdrawal of nomination paper to the date of poll; (iii) there was no violation of Rule 10(5) of the Conduct of Election Rules; and (iv) even assuming that there was violation of this rule, the election petitioner dismally failed to prove by evidence that the result of the election was materially affected thereby, inasmuch as no sufficient evidence was adduced in proof of his claim, and he himself could not have proved his aver ments. Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: (1) Under s.30 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, as soon as the notification calling upon a con stituency to elect the member or members is issued, the Election Commission shall, by notification in the Official Gazette appoint, amongst others, under clause (d), the date or dates on which a poll shall, if necessary, be taken, which or the first of which shall be a date not earlier than the twentieth day after the last date for the withdrawal of candidature. [928F] (2) In the instant case, the last date for the withdraw al of nomination was 9.2.1985 and the date of poll was 5.3.1985. There was, therefore, clear compliance with the requirement of section 30(d). The respondent himself stated that on 14.2.1985 he received notice of intention of the Return ing Officer to change his election symbol and the symbol was actually changed on 15.2.1985. This Court agrees with the High Court that only the spirit of section 30(d) was not complied with. In terms, this provision was clearly complied with. [928G 929A] (3) The violation of sub rule (5) of Rule 10 per se will not invalidate the election. The election petitioner has also to prove that the result of the election, in so far as it concerns the returned candidate, was materially affected. [934A B] (4) The party who wishes to get an election declared void has to establish by satisfactory evidence that the result of the poll had in fact been materially affected by the violation of Rule 10(5) of the Rules. For doing this, it has to be demonstrated that the votes would have been di verted in such a way that the returned candidate would have been unsuccessfull.

(5) A decision in an election petition can be given only on positive and affirmative evidence and not on mere specu lation and suspicion, however, strong they are. In the instant case, there is no such positive and affirmative evidence. Mere assertions by the election petitioner were not enough. [932D] (6) There could be no proposition or contention that a candidate with a particular symbol would always be success ful at the hustings or that a particular voter or a number of voters would always vote for a symbol irrespective of the candidate to whom it is allotted. [932E] (7) There is no dispute about the importance of the symbol in a backward constituency.

How could that be proved would. of course, depends on the facts and circumstances of the case.

            "Target: The appellant and the respondents entered into a contract for the construction of Building Dock. Clause 40 of the General Conditions of Contract entered into between the parties, provided that \"all questions and disputes relating to the meaning of the Specifications Estimates Instructions, Designs, Drawing and the quality of the workmanship or materials used in the work or as to another questions, claim, right, matter or thing whatsoever in any way arising out of or relating to the contract or otherwise concerning the execution whether arising during the progress of the work or after completion shall be referred to the Sole Arbitrator etc,\" During the implementation of the works contract. disputes arose between the parties in respect of a claim for compensation on account of the increase in the cost of imported pile driving equipment and technical know how fees. Correspondence was exchanged between the Appellant and Respondent No. 1 and the dispute was referred to the Sole Arbitrator. The point referred were: (1) Whether the claim of compensation for increase in the cost of imported pile driving equipment and technical know how fees would fall within the purview of the first para of clause 40 of the General Conditions of Contract; and (2) if it does, the quantum of compensation, if any, to which the appellant would be entitled to. The arbitrator entered upon the reference and after hearing the parties gave his award. The 119 arbitrator held that the appellant was entitled to compensation for the increase in the cost of imported pile drawing equipment and technical know how fees by a sum of Rs. 99 lakhs which amount shall be payable with interest @ 9.1/2% The award was typed on stamp paper of the value of Rs.150/ The arbitrator forwarded the award to both the parties. The appellant moved a petition under sections 14 and 17 of the , in the Court of the Subordinate Judge for filing the award and for making it a rule of the Court, while the respondent moved a petition under sections 30 and 33 for setting aside the award contending that: (1) the award was insufficiently stamped, and (2) the arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction by misconstruing clause 40. The Subordinate Judge negatived both the contentions. It was held that the respondent having submitted the question whether the dispute raised by the appellant was covered by the arbitration clause; could not controvert the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to decide the dispute; and the award of the arbitrator was modified in the matter of interest from 9.1/2 per cent as awarded by the arbitrator to 6 per cent, and the award was made a rule of the Court. The respondent preferred an appeal to the High Court, and a Division Bench, agreed with the Subordinate Judge on the question of insufficiency of stamp. It however held that the question whether the dispute was arbitrable or not could not be finally decided by the arbitrator because it was a matter relating to his jurisdiction, and that the arbitrator cannot by an erroneous interpretation or construction of the clause confer jurisdiction on himself and that the court can go into the question whether the matter in dispute between the parties was covered by the arbitration clause. It finally held that even though the arbitration clause was very wide, the dispute as to compensation for increase in the cost of imported pile driving equipment and technical know how fees could not be covered by the arbitration clause because under clause 26 every plant, machinery and equipment had to be provided by the contractor and any rise or escalation in the price of such equipment or machinery, cannot be the subject matter of compensation by the respondent. The appeal was therefore allowed, and the trial court 's order, making the award a rule of the court was set aside and directed that the award be returned to the parties. In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant, that though Sec. 16(1)(e) of the may permit the court to remit or set aside the award on the ground that there is an error of law apparent on the face of it, yet where a specific question of law has been referred to the arbitrator for decision, the fact that the decision is erroneous does not make the award bad on its face so as to permit its being set aside. As a specific question of law touching upon the jurisdiction of the arbitrator was speficially referred to the arbitrator for his decision, the decision of the arbitrator is binding on the parties and the court cannot proceed to inquire whether upon a true construction of the arbitration clause, the dispute referred to the arbitrator for arbitration would be covered by the arbitration clause so as to clothe the arbitrator with the jurisdiction to arbitrate upon the dispute. On behalf of the respondent, it was contended that the jurisdiction of the arbitrator cannot be left to the decision of the arbitrator so as to be binding on 120 the parties and it is always for the court to decide whether the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the dispute, and that the arbitrator cannot by a misconstruction of the arbitration agreement clothe himself with or confer upon himself the jurisdiction to decide the dispute. Allowing the Appeal; ^ HELD: 1. A specific question of law touching the jurisdiction of the arbitrator was specifically referred to the arbitrator and therefore the arbitrator 's decision is binding on the parties and the award cannot be set aside on the sole ground that there was an error of law apparent on the face of the award. It is also established that the claim for compensation made by the contractor which led to the dispute was covered by the arbitration clause. The quantum of compensation awarded by the arbitrator was never disputed nor questioned. [170E F] 2. A question of law may figure before an arbitrator in two ways. It may arise as an incidental point while deciding the main dispute referred to the arbitrator or in a given case parties may refer a specific question of law to the arbitrator for his decision. [137G H] Russel: Law of Arbitration Twentieth Edition p.22; Halsbury 's Laws of England Vol. 2 Para 623 4th Edition referred to. Arbitration has been considered a civilised way of resolving disputes avoiding court proceedings. There is no reason why the parties should be precluded from referring a specific question of law to an arbitrator for his decision and agree to be bound by the same. This approach manifests faith of parties in the capacity of the tribunal of their choice to decide even a pure question of law. If they do so, with eyes wide open, and there is nothing to preclude the parties from doing so, then there is no reason why the court should try to impose its view of law superseding the view of the Tribunal whose decision the parties agreed to abide by. On Principle it appears distinctly clear that when a specific question of law is referred to an arbitrator for his decision including the one touching upon the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, the decision of the arbitrator would be binding on both the parties and it would not be open to any of the two parties to wriggle out of it by contending that the arbitrator cannot clutch at or confer jurisdiction upon himself by mis construing the arbitration agreement.[138 E G] 4. If a question of law is specifically referred and it becomes evident that the parties desired to have a decision on the specific question from the arbitrator rather than one from the court, then the court will not interfere with the award of the arbitrator on the ground that there is an error or law apparent on the face of the award even if the view of law taken by the arbitrator does not accord with the view of the court.

The expression 'without prejudice ' carries a technical meaning depending upon the context in which it is used. An action taken without prejudice to one 's right cannot necessarily mean that the entire action can be ignored by the party taking the same. [148F G] In the instant case, in the context in which the expression 'without prejudice ' is used, it would only mean that the respondent reserved the right to contend before the arbitrator that the dispute is not covered by the arbitration clause. It does not appear that what was a contention that no specific question was specifically referred to the arbitrator, On a proper reading of the correspondence, and in the setting in which the term 'without prejudice ' is used, it only means that the respondent reserved to itself the right to contend before the arbitrator that a dispute raised or the claim made by the contractor was not covered by the arbitration clause. No other meaning can be assigned to it. [148D E] 6. In works contract of such magnitude, and which have been undertaken by an Indian contractor for the first time negotiations prior to the finalisation of the contact and the correspondence leading to the formation of contract supply the basis on which the contract was finally entered into. Undoubtedly, if in the final written contract, there is something contrary to the basic understanding during the formative stage of the contract, the written contract would prevail. But if the contract does not indicate to the contary and the assumptions appeared to be the foundation of the contract, that aspect cannot be overlooked while determining what were the obligations undertaken the formal contract. [151H 152B] 7. Over simplification of the clauses of the contract involving works of large magnitude is impermissible. The whole gamut of discussions, negotiations and correspondence must be taken into consideration to arrive at a true meaning of what was agreed to between the parties. [156F] In the instant case, there is no room for doubt that the parties agreed that the investment of the contractor under this head would be Rs. 2 crores and the tendered rates were predicated upon and co related to this understanding.[156G] 122 8. When an agreement is predicated upon an agreed fact situation, if the latter ceases to exist the agreement to that extent becomes irrelevant of otiose. [156G] 9. Phrases such as 'claim arising out of contract ' or 'relating to the contract ' or 'concerning the contract ' on proper construction would mean that if while entertaining or rejecting the claim or the dispute in relation to claim may be entertained or rejected after reference to the contract, it is a claim arising out of contract. The language of clause 40 shows that any claim arising out of the contract in relation to estimates made in the contract would be covered by the arbitration clause. If it becomes necessary to have recourse to the contract to settle the dispute one way or the other then certainly it can be said that it is a dispute arising out of the contract. [157F G] In the instant case, the arbitration clause is so widely worded as disputes arising out of the contract or in relation to the contract or execution of the works that it would comprehend, within its compass a claim for compensation related to estimates and arising out of the contract. [157H] 10. (i) A dispute, the determination of which turns on the true construction of the contract, would also seem to be a dispute under arising out of or concerning the contract. The test is that if in settling a dispute, a reference to the contract is necessary, such a dispute would be covered by the arbitration clause.[158D E] A.M.

Where the parties are at one in asserting that they entered into a binding contract, but a difference has arisen between them whether there has been a breach by one side or the other, or whether circumstances have arisen which have discharged one or both parties from further performance, such differences should be regarded as differences which have arisen 'in respect of ' or 'with regard to ' of 'under ' the contract, and an arbitration clause which uses these, or similar expressions should be contoured accordingly.

The courts below found that the requirement of the landlord was bonafide and ordered eviction of the tenants under section 12 (l) (f) and (h) of the Act. In these appeals the tenants contended that since the eviction ordered was under section 12 (l) (h), section 18 of the Act was attracted and it was obligatory on the part of the landlord to provide accommodation of equal extent to the tenants in the new building to be constructed by him. Dismissing the appeals, ^ HELD: In Ramnilal P.

The fact that section 12 (1) (h) is also mentioned in the order of the Court below does not make the order of eviction purely one under that section, for the main ground of requirement of the landlord is bonafide personal requirement for locating his proposed factory for the manufacture of gold or silver ornaments.

            "Target: The respondent assessee an existing company under the had neither any share capital nor distributed any dividend to its members and its entire income was expended for fulfilment of its objects, which were the promotion, protection and development of trade, commerce and industry in India. During the assessment year 1962 63, the relevant accounting year for which the year ended December 31, 1961 the assessee submitted a return showing its total income as 'nil ' claiming that all its income was exempt under section 11(1)(a) read with Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act. During the assessment year, the assessee held the Indian Trade Fair at New Delhi and derived receipts from rent for space allotted, temporary stalls and storage and realised deposit and advances from the participants for hotel accommodation. In the relevant accounting year, the Conference of the Afro Asian Organisation for Economic Cooperation, was sponsored by the assessee and for organising the Conference, the assessee received from the Government Rs. 3 lakhs as grant in aid and after meeting the expenses, was left with a balance of Rs. 2 lakhs. It also received income by sale of books, fee for arbitration etc. The balance sheet for the accounting year indicated that it had an excess of income over expenditure under the head 'income '. The contention of the assessee before the Income Tax Officer was that the activities carried on by the Federation were not were not motive of earning profits, but that they were carried on with the object of promotion, protection and development of trade, commerce and industry in India and abroad, and therefore the income derived by the assessee was exempt under section 11(1)(a). The Income Tax Officer, held that the decision of this Court in the Andhra Chamber of Commerce 's case [1965] I.S.C.R. 565 was no longer good law due to the addition of the words 'not involving the carrying on any activity for profit ' in the definition of 'charitable purpose ' in Section 2(15) of the Act which qualify the fourth head of charity viz. 'any other object of general public utility ' and, therefore, must be read subject to the additional statutory requirement that the 490 object of general public utility should not involve the carrying on of any activity for profit, and accordingly raised a demand. On appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner disagreed with the view of the Income Tax Officer and held that the activities carried on by the assessee were not profit oriented and, therefore, its income was exempt. The Department appealed to the Appellate Tribunal, and the Appellate Tribunal upheld the view of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and held that the dominant object with which the Federation was constituted being a charitable purpose viz., promotion, protection and development of trade, commerce and industry, there being no motive to earn profits, it was not engaged in any activity in the nature of business or trade, and, if, any income arose from such activity, it was only incidental or ancillary to the dominant object for the welfare and common good of the country 's trade, commerce and industry. The Commissioner of Income Tax applied to the Appellate Tribunal to make a reference to the High Court under sub section (1) of section 256 of the Act, but in view of the conflict in the decisions of the High Courts on the construction of the expression 'charitable purpose ' as defined in section 2(15) of the Act the Tribunal made a reference to this Court under Section 257 . On the question whether the words 'not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit ' in the definition of 'charitable purpose ' contained in section 2(15) of the Act, govern the word 'advancement ' and not the words 'object of general public utility '. ^ HELD: [By the Court] The reference must be answered against the Revenue and in favour of the assessee, in the view of the majority opinion in Addl. Commissioner of Income Tax vs Surat Art Silk Cloth Manufactures, [1980] I S.C.R. 77. [492 F] [Per A.P. Sen, J.] 1. The majority view in the Surat Art Silk case was that the condition that the purpose should not involve the carrying on of any activity for profit would be satisfied if profit making is not the real object. The theory of dominant or primary object of the trust, has, therefore, been treated to be the determining factor, even in regard to the fourth head of charity, viz. advancement of any other object of general public utility, so as to make the carrying on of business activity merely ancillary or incidental to the main object. This doctrine of dominant or primary object holds the field till there is a change of law. [496 C D, 497 F] 2. The majority decision had the effect of neutralising the radical changes brought about by Parliament in the system of taxation of income and profits of charities, with particular reference to \"object of general public utility\" to prevent tax evasion, by diversion of business profits to charities. It is the vagueness of the fourth head of charity \"any other object of general public utility\" that impelled 491 Parliament to insert the restrictive words \"not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit\". [496 G 497 A] 3. It was clearly inconsistent with the settled principles to hold that if the dominant or primary object of a trust was 'charity ' under the fourth head 'any other object of general public utility ', it was permissible for such an object of general public utility to augment its income by engaging in trading or commercial activities.[497 B] 4. When the Government did not accept the recommendation of the Direct Taxes Laws Committee in Chapter 2 for the deletion of the words \"not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit\" occurring in Section 2(15) of the Act, it was impermissible for the Court by a process of judicial construction to achieve the same result. [496 F] 5. In the instant case, activities of the assessee in regard to holding of the Indian Trade Fair and sponsoring of the Conference of the Afro Asian organisation in the relevant accounting year were for the advancement of the dominant object and purpose of the trust, viz. promotion, protection and development of trade, commerce and industry in India. The income derived from such activities was therefore exempt under section 11(1)(a) read with section 2(15) of the Act. [498 G 499 A] 6. There is a distinction between the \"purpose\" of a trust and the \"power conferred upon the trustees\" as incidental to the carrying out of the purpose. If the primary or dominant purpose of a trust or institute is charitable, any other object which is merely ancillary or incidental to the primary or dominant purpose, would not prevent the trust or the institution being a valid charity. [498 G, 499 A] [Per Venkataramiah, J.] 1. It is open to the Legislature to give encouragement to objects which it considers to be laudable by means of fiscal exemptions. At the same time, it takes care to enact fresh provisions from time to time to suppress any mischief which may have resulted from the misuse of existing law. Parliament deliberately stepped in by adding the words \"not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit\" in the definition of 'charitable purpose ' in section 2(15) of the Act, when the tax exemptions available to charitable and religious trusts came to be misused by some for the unworthy purposes of tax avoidance. The law had been so restructured to prevent allergy to taxation masquerading as charity. The law was thus designed by Parliament to prevent this misuse of tax exemption in the name of charity. [500 F H] 2. This Court has enlarged the meaning \"charitable purpose\" in Section 2(15) beyond what it legitimately should mean in the Surat Art Silk Cloth Manufacturers Association 's case. It has virtually wiped off the restrictive words \"not involving the carrying on or any activity for profit\" occurring in section 2(15), thereby defeating the very object and purpose of the legislation. It is not the function of a court of law to give the words a strained and unnatural meaning. Judicial attitudes cannot be formed in isolation from legislative processes, particularly, in connection with tax avoidance provisions. [500 D, 501A, 500E] 492 3. Modern legislation has changed in pattern re casting provisions of taxation with very wide language, while at the same time dealing in much more detail with some areas of law. Judges while responding to general trends of law, but also reacting to the form of modern tax legislation, must be prepared to take account of the context and purposes of the change brought about.[501 E] Greenberg vs Inland Revenue Commissioners [1972] A.C. 109 (HL) referred to. When the Government had not accepted the recommendation of the Direct Taxes Laws Committee in Chapter 2 for the deletion of the words \"not involving the carrying on of any activity for profit\", by suitable legislation, it was impermissible by a process of judicial construction to achieve the same result. [501 B] 5. People who are truly charitable do not think of the tax benefits while making charities. Even the poor who do not pay income tax can be charitable and their charities are made at great personal inconvenience. Charitable persons are not amongst the tax payers only. [502 H 503 A] \n",

When P accompanied A to the theatre and from there to Bohori Kathada he knew that she was going for plying her profession as a prostitute. Held, that the appellant could not in law be held guilty of abetting the commission of an offence under section 366A of the Indian Penal Code by P. A person who merely accompanies a woman going out to ply her profession of a prostitute, even if she has not attained the age of 18 years, could not be said thereby to induce her to go from any place or to do any act with the intent or knowledge that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse within the meaning of section 366 A. Seduction implies surrender of her body by a woman who is otherwise reluctant or unwilling to submit herself to illicit intercourse whether such surrender is for the first time or is preceded by similar surrender on earlier occasions ; but where a person in the course of her profession as a prostitute offers herself for profession as a prostitute offers herself for intercourse, there are no sucruples nor reluctance to be overcome, and surrender by her is not seduction within the Code. \n",

His family at the material time consisted of himself, his wife and two minor daughters. The appellant claimed to be assessed in the status of a Hindu Undivided Family inasmuch as the wealth returned consisted of ancestral property received or deemed to have been received by him on partition with his father and brothers. The Wealth Tax Officer did not accept the contention of. the appellant and assessed him as an individual. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed this view. However the Appellate Tribunal held that the appellant should be assessed in the status of Hindu Undivided Family but the High Court, upon a reference, disagreed with the view of the Appellate Tribunal and held that as the appellant family did not have any other male coparcener, all the assets forming the 'subject matter of the returns filed by the appellant belonged to him as an individual and not to a Hindu Undivided Family. On appeal to this Court, HELD:Allowing the appeal: The status of the appellant was rightly determined as that of a Hindu ,Undivided Family by the Appellate Tribunal. The expression \"Hindu Undivided Family\" in the Wealth Tax Act is used in the sense in which a Hindu joint family is understood in the personal law of Hindus. Under the Hindu system of law a joint family may consist of a single male member and his wife and daughters and there is nothing in the scheme of the Wealth Tax Act to suggest that a Hindu Undivided Family as an assessable unit must consist of at least two male members. [886 C] Under section 3 of the Wealth Tax Act not a Hindu coparcenary but a Hindu Undivided Family is one of the assessable legal entities. A Hindu joint family consists of all persons lineally descended from a common ancestor, and includes their wives and unmarried daughters. A Hindu coparcenary is a much narrower body than the Hindu joint family; it in cludes only those persons who acquire by birth an interest in the joint or coparcenary property, these being the sons, grand sons and great grand sons of the holder of the joint property for the time being.

Consequently,. he was dismissed from service. The dispute arising therefrom was referred to the Labour Court, Dhanbad under section 10(1)(c) of the Act for adjudication.

It is a rule to ensure that vast power in the modern State is not abused but properly exercised. The State power is used for proper and not for improper purposes. The authority is not misguided by extraneous or irrelevant consideration. Fairness is also a principle to ensure that statutory authority arrives at a just decision either in promoting the interest or affecting the rights of persons. The concept that 'justice should not only be done but be seen to be done ' is the essence of fairness and is equally applicable to administrative authorities. Fairness is thus a prime test for proper and good administration. It has no set form or procedure.

The State in fairness ought to have got it verified by giving an opportunity to the management which was a party to the pending reference. The management was not required to establish particular prejudice for want of such opportunity. The non observance of natural justice was itself prejudice to the management and proof of prejudice independently of proof of denial of natural justice was unnecessary.

Most of the factors, however, do not point that way. The workman and his family members seem to be still residing in the colony quarter at Dhanbad. His two sons are studying in a school at a nearby village. The letter dated September 8, 1988 of the Headmaster of the said school speaks of that fact. The letter from the Assistant Electrical Engineer in proof of the electricity supplied to the quarter occupied by the workman at Dhanbad is also relevant. As against these mate rials, the workman has not produced any proof in support of his allegation that he has been residing in a village home near Patna.

            "Target: The central issue in these appeals is whether at common law an employee can recover damages for loss arising from the unfair manner of his dismissal in breach of an express term of an employment contract. Each of Mr Edwardss and Mr Bothams employment contracts contained express terms governing the procedure for dismissal in cases of misconduct and each were summarily dismissed from their employment as, respectively, consultant orthopaedic surgeon and youth community worker [3], [15]. In Mr Edwards case, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against him in December 2005. He was alleged to have undertaken an inappropriate internal examination of a female patient and then denied that the examination had taken place [4]. In February 2006, a disciplinary hearing was held and the panel decided that he should be summarily dismissed for gross personal and professional misconduct [5]. By a claim issued in the High Court in August 2008, Mr Edwards claimed damages for breach of his employment contract and its wrongful termination. Among other procedural breaches, he alleged that the disciplinary panel had not been constituted in line with the applicable policy, which formed a term of his contract. His case was that, if the panel had included a clinician of the same discipline as him, his contract would not have been terminated. His preliminary schedule of loss alleged that he lost earnings (past and future) of over 3.8 million [9]. Mr Botham was suspended from work in December 2002 and was charged with gross misconduct for behaving inappropriately in relation to two teenage girls. Following disciplinary proceedings, in September 2003 he was summarily dismissed for gross misconduct. Because his misconduct was in relation to young people, he was placed on the list of persons deemed unsuitable to work with children under the Protection of Children Act 1999 (the POCA list) [14]. Mr Botham brought proceedings in respect of his dismissal in the employment tribunal. In May 2007, it held he had been unfairly dismissed and his summary dismissal was a breach of contract. In relation to the unfair dismissal, it found that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had breached express terms of his contract set out in the Discipline Code found in the MoDs Personnel Manual [15]. The tribunal awarded him 7,000 loss of salary and benefits for his notice period, a basic award of 1,989 and a compensatory award of 53,500. His name was removed from the POCA list [16]. Mr Botham then issued proceedings in the High Court seeking damages for breach of the express terms of his contract. Relying on the findings of the tribunal, he alleged that the MoD, in conducting the disciplinary process, failed to comply with provisions of the Disciplinary Code, by reason of which he suffered a loss of reputation, was put on the POCA list and prevented from obtaining further employment in his chosen field. The Supreme Court by a majority allows the appeal. Employees may not recover damages for loss suffered as a result of a breach of a term in their employment contract as to the manner of their dismissal unless the loss can be said to precede and be independent of the dismissal. Compensation for the manner of dismissal is limited to what they may recover pursuant to the Employment Rights Act 1996 (the 1996 Act). Lord Dyson gives the leading judgment with which Lord Mance (adding further comments) and Lord Walker agree. Lord Phillips agrees that the appeals should be allowed, but for different reasons. Lady Hale and Lords Kerr and Wilson dissent. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd [2001] UKHL 13, the House of Lords held that loss arising from the unfair manner of dismissal is not recoverable as damages for breach of the implied term of trust and confidence in employment contracts: it falls within what has been called the Johnson exclusion area [1]. By the time of the report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers Associations 1965 1968 (the Donovan report) it was settled law that an employee was not entitled to recover damages in respect of the manner of his dismissal. The Donovan report recommended that the law should be changed and that statute should establish machinery to safeguard against unfair dismissal [21]. Parliament gave effect to this recommendation in the Industrial Relations Act 1971. The relevant provisions are now contained in the 1996 Act. But Parliament placed significant limitations on the ability of an employee to complain of unfair dismissal, such as the three month time limit for bringing a claim, and on the remedies available: there is a cap on the level of the compensatory award (now 68,400). Therefore, Parliament decided to give a remedy which was less generous than that which the common law would give for breach of contract in the ordinary way [19] [23]. In each legislative modification to the unfair dismissal scheme, Parliament linked failure to comply with disciplinary procedures with the outcome of unfair dismissal proceedings; the provisions about disciplinary procedure were intended to operate within the scope of the law of unfair (not wrongful) dismissal [30] [37]. It follows that, if provisions about disciplinary procedures are incorporated as express terms of an employment contract, they are not ordinary contractual terms. Parliament intended such provisions to apply to employment contracts to protect employees from unfair dismissal. It has specified the consequences of a failure to comply in unfair dismissal proceedings. It could not have intended that they would also give rise to a common law claim for damages. Unless the parties express otherwise, they are taken not to intend that a failure to comply with contractual disciplinary procedures will give rise to a common law claim for damages [37] [39],[94]. This is regardless of whether the term is express or implied. A dismissal may be unfair for a variety of reasons and any such complaint was intended by Parliament to be adjudicated on by the specialist employment tribunal, not that an employee could choose to pursue his complaint of unfair dismissal in the ordinary courts, free from the limitations carefully crafted by Parliament [40]. However, other remedies, such as injunction, which do not cut across the statutory scheme, are not excluded [44]. Whether individual cases fall within the Johnson exclusion area is a matter of fact and depends on whether the procedural breach forms part of the dismissal process: [51]. Mr Edwards dismissal flowed from the panels erroneous findings, which flowed from its improper constitution. Likewise, Mr Botham alleges that the loss of reputation was caused by the dismissal itself. Both cases therefore fall within the Johnson exclusion area [55] [59], [99]. \n",

            "Target: This appeal relates to bonds issued by the respondent, the Republic of Argentina (Argentina), in respect of which, together with all its other debt, Argentina declared a moratorium in December 2001. The appellant NML Capital Limited (NML) is an affiliate of a New York based hedge fund, which purchased the bonds at little over half their face value between June 2001 and September 2003 and then pursued the respondent for the return of their full principal value and interest in the New York courts. On 11 May 2006 NML obtained summary judgment on the bonds from a Federal Court in New York for over $284m. It then sought to enforce the judgment against assets held by Argentina in England by bringing a common law action on the judgment in London. NML applied for permission to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction on Argentina, initially alleging two reasons why Argentina was not entitled to state immunity. The first was that Argentina had waived immunity as a term of its agreement with Bankers Trust to issue the bonds, and the second that the claim constituted proceedings relating to a commercial transaction and so fell within the exception in section 3(1)(a) of the State Immunity Act 1978 (the 1978 Act). Permission was granted and the proceedings were served. Argentina then applied to have the order for service set aside. NML resisted this application by reliance on two different grounds: the provisions of section 31 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (the 1982 Act) and terms as to waiver and jurisdiction in the bonds themselves. The High Court dismissed Argentinas application but this decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal, which held that Argentina was protected by state immunity from the claim. The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Phillips and Lord Clarke find that the claim falls within the scope of section 3(1)(a) of the 1978 Act. Lord Mance, Lord Collins and Lord Walker disagree on this point but all agree that the appeal should in any event succeed by reason of the provisions of s 31 of the 1982 Act and by Argentinas submission and waiver of immunity in the bonds. The scope of s 3(1)(a) of the 1978 Act Sections 1 11 of the 1978 Act are a comprehensive statement of the scope of state immunity under the law of the United Kingdom. During the twentieth century there was a growing recognition around the world of the restrictive doctrine of state immunity, under which immunity was given to governmental acts in the exercise of sovereign authority but not to commercial activities carried on by the state [10]. S 3(1)(a) made it clear that the UK was adopting the restrictive doctrine. The context for interpreting the phrase proceedings relating to a commercial transaction in this case was the enforcement of a judgment which absent state immunity would be permitted by Civil Procedure Rule 6.20(9). Lord Phillips and Lord Clarke considered that the words relating to should be given a broad rather than a narrow meaning. The proceedings related both to the foreign judgment and to the transaction underlying that judgment [26]. Although Parliament was unlikely to have thought the 1978 Act to apply to a class of foreign judgments at a time when there was no procedural machinery to serve a defendant out of the jurisdiction, s 3(1)(a) should be given an updated meaning consistent with the statutory purpose of the act [152]. Lord Mance did not think it was justified to treat the wording of s 3(1)(a) as applying to a foreign judgment against a foreign state, which had long been recognised as a special area of private international law [80]. S 31 of the 1982 Act was the means by which Parliament had achieved for the first time a comprehensive treatment of the issue of state immunity in respect of foreign judgments [98][118]. Lord Collins (with whom Lord Walker agreed) pointed to the almost invariable use in international loan agreements and bond issues since the 1970s of clauses providing for submission to national jurisdiction and waivers of immunity [103]. He preferred a narrow interpretation of s 3(1)(a). There was no policy reason to give it a wider meaning in the light of s 31 of the 1982 Act and the widespread use of express waivers [116]. Effect of s 31 of the 1982 Act S 31 of the 1982 Act reflected and in part replaced the categories of exemption from state immunity set out in the 1978 Act as far as foreign judgments were concerned. It was an alternative scheme rather than an additional hurdle [47]. State immunity could not be raised as a bar to the recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment if, under the principles of international law recognised in this jurisdiction, the state against whom the judgment was given was not entitled to immunity in respect of the claim [49]. Did the bonds contain a submission to the jurisdiction of the English court? The High Court had correctly held that the agreement in the bond was more than a mere waiver and amounted to a submission to jurisdiction [59]. It was the only meaning the provision could sensibly bear [62] [128]. Could NML rely on new issues at the High Court hearing? Lord Phillips considered that the rule in Parker v Schuller (1901) should no longer be applied. Allowing a party to amend a pleading where no prejudice was caused to the other party that could not be dealt with by an appropriate order for costs accorded with the overriding objective [75]. The other justices did not think that the rule applied on the facts of this case, but agreed with his observations. \n",

In their report under section 173 the police stated that the complaint was false in that on the date and time mentioned therein, the appellant was at a different place far away from the place where the complainant alleged that the appellant had threatened to kill him. Disagreeing with the conclusion of the police the Magistrate took cognizance of the case under sections 448, 451 and 506 I.P.C. and directed the issue of process to the appellant. The appellant 's petition seeking to quash the proceedings before the Magistrate was dismissed by the High Court. In appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the Magistrate was not competent to take cognizance of the case as if it was upon a police report since the report under section 173 by the police did not disclose any offence having been committed by the appellant. Dismissing the appeal ^ HELD: Where the Magistrate, on receiving a complaint orders investigation under section 156(3) and receives a report under section 173 to the effect that no offence was disclosed against the accused, the Magistrate might either (i) decide that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding further and drop action or (ii) he may take cognizance of the offence under section 190(1)(b) and issue process without being bound in any manner by the conclusion of the police or (iii) he may take cognizance of the offence under section 190(1)(a) on the basis of the original complaint and proceed to examine upon oath the complainant and his witnesses under section 200. If he adopts the third alternative, he may hold or direct an enquiry under section 202 if he thinks fit. Thereafter he may dismiss the complaint or issue process as the case may be. [940E G] In any event, it is impossible to say that the Magistrate, who takes cognizance of an offence on the basis of the facts disclosed in the police report, 936 must be said to have taken cognizance of the offence \"on suspicion\" and not upon police report, merely because he and the police arrived at different conclusions from the facts. The Magistrate is not bound by the conclusions of the police: if he ignores their conclusions and takes cognizance of the offence himself, he does so upon the facts disclosed by the police report though not on the conclusions arrived at by them. In such a case, it cannot be said that he was taking cognizance \"on suspicion\".

The argument of the appellant that the Court, in this case, had apparently taken the view that the Magistrate could take cognizance of the offence not under section 190 (1)(b) as if it was a police report but under section 190(1)(c) as if it was \"on suspicion\" is not sustainable, because section 190(1)(c) was never intended to apply to cases where there was a police report under section 173(1).

(2) Are the members of the public entitled to worship in that temple as of right ? (3) Are the temple expenses met from the. contributions made by the public ? (4) Whether the sevas and utsavas conducted in the temple are those usually conducted in public temples ? (5) Have the management as well as the devotees been treating the temple as a public temple. Though the appearance of a temple is a relevant circumstance, it is by no means 'a decisive one. The architecture of temples differs from place to place. The circumstance that the public or a section thereof have been regularly worshiping in the. temple as a matter of course and they can take part in the festivals 'and ceremonies conducted in that temple apparently as a matter of right is a strong piece of evidence to establish the public character of the temple. If votive offerings are being made by the public in the usual course and if the expenses of the temple are met by public contribution, it is safe to presume that the temple question is a public temple. In brief the origin of the temple. , the manner in which its affairs are managed, the nature and extent of gifts received by it, rights exercised by the devotees in regard to worship therein, the consciousness of the manager and the consciousness of the devotees themselves as to the public character of the temple are factors that go to establish whether a temple is public temple or a private temple.

            "Target: A widow whose estate was under the charge of the Court of Wards. made an adoption and applied under section 37 of the U.P. Court of Wards Act, 1912, for permission to make the adoption. The Collector refused the permission as the grant of authority to adopt, by the husband who died in 1901, was not proved. The 1st respondent 's father, the nearest reversioner, filed a suit challenging the adoption as contrary to section 37 of the Act and the suit was decreed. The widow. there.after, applied to the Court of Wards for permission to adopt the appellant. Fresh enquiries about grant of authority by the husband to adopt, were made, and permission was granted and the appellant was adopted in 1929. Immediately after the adoption of the appellant the Court of Wards, released the estate and assumed charge of it again on behalf of the appellant who was a minor. On the death of the widow in 1943, the 1st respondent 's father filed a suit, challenging the validity of the appellant 's adoption on the ground that the widow had no authority from her husband to adopt. The Trial Court decreed the suit and the High Court, on appeal. affirmed the decree. In appeal to this Court it was contended that the conclusion of the Court of Wards to grant permission and the reasons for the decision could not be questioned in a civil suit. HELD: The Civil Court was competent to reconsider the question, of the authority given by the husband, even after the consent of the Court of Wards. Section 37 of the U.P. Court of Wards Act affects the competence of the wards to make an adoption, and as the consent of the Court of Wards is a pre requisite, any adoption made without such consent must be ineffective. The section, however, does not make the sanction of the Court of Wards cure illegalities or breaches of personal law. Nor does the sanction make up for incompetence arising under the personal law. Those matters would have to be determ/ned according to the personal law in a Civil Court of competent jurisdiction. [30E G] Section 53 also is not a bar to such a suit. The section only provides that if the Court of Wards gave or refused its consent to a proposed adoption a suit would not lie to cancel the consent or to compel it. It does not go to the length of saying that after the consent of the Court of Wards, the adoption itself cannot be questioned at all. [30H] In deciding the question of authority, the statements made by witnesses at the second enquiry by the Court of Wards for giving its consent to adopt, could not be considered by the Civil Court they were not relevant or admissible either under section 32(7) or section ,of the Indian Evidence Act. [32 D F; 33 A C] 28 As the 1st respondent 's father never accepted the appellant 's adoption it could not be said that the suit, filed more than 15 years after the adoption during which time the appellant had been considered by everyone to be legally and validly adopted, ought to be dismissed.

            "Target: The assessee carries on business of running Oil Mill and dealing in groundnuts, groundnut seeds and oil, speculative business in groundnuts, groundnut oil and groundnut seeds, and speculation business in cotton errands etc. The I.T.O. disallowed loss in forward contracts and groundnut oil, groundnuts and groundnut seeds on the ground that it arose out of illegal contracts on account of the same being banned under section 15(4) of the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner on appeal confirmed the decision of the l. T.O. but bifurcated the loss into two headings, namely, loss incurred in hedging transac tions m the banned items and loss incurred in speculative transactions. On second appeal, the Tribunal held that notwithstanding the illegality of the transactions the loss could be set off and carried forward in accordance with the provisions of section 24(1) and 24(2) of the Income Tax Act, 1922. The Tribunal accordingly directed that the loss in hedging transactions of forward business in the banned contracts be set off against the other profits of the asses see for the relevant accounting year under section 24(1) and that balance of loss relating to the speculative transac tions in the banned contracts be carried forward to the following year under section 24(2) of the Act to be set off against profit of the following year from speculative busi ness. On reference to the High Court, the High Court an swered both the questions in favour of the assessee and upheld the judgment of the Tribunal. The High Court relied on its earlier judgment in the case of C.I.T. vs S.C. Ko thari. Allowing the appeal by certificate HELD: (1) The loss incurred ,in the hedging transactions cannot be set off against other profits in the previous year in view of the decision of this Court partly reversing the judgment of the High Court in the case of S.C. Kothari. [31C D] Commissioner of Income tax vs S.C. Kothari, , ap plied. (2) It is admitted that the contract for speculation in the commodity in question is banned under the Forward Con tracts (Regulation) Act 1952. To allow such a loss to be carried forward is to permit a benefit of adjustment of loss from an illegal business to spill over and continue in the following year even in a lawful speculative business. The speculative business which is carried on in the following year must be a business of lawful speculation pertaining to the lawful and enforceable contracts. An assessee carrying on a lawful speculative business in the following year cannot derive benefit by carrying forward and setting off a loss from illegal speculative business of the earlier year. Law will assume an illegal business to die out of existence with all its losses to the assessee in the year of loss itself. The assessee can derive no benefit on account of the unlawful business in the following year. The matter will be different if a lawful speculative business after incurring loss is 27 discontinued and loss thereupon is carried forward for set off against any other lawful speculative business in the following year. It is inconceivable that law can permit an illegal activity to be carried on from which a benefit could be obtained. The concept of carry forward is not the same thing as the setting off of loss in a particular illegal business against profit of that illegal business in a par ticular year. The two concepts have to be kept distinctly separate even in a taxing statute. It is true that by earning income from illegal trading activity the business does not get tainted so far as exigibility to tax is con cerned. While computing income from illegal activity in a particular year all losses incurred in earning that particu lar income are also taken into account for computation of real profits even in the illegal business. There is a marked distinction between the computation of a particular year 's profit from illegal trading activity and carry for ward of a loss to set it off against income in the subse quent years even assuming that such illegal activity is continued against the provisions of law. No illegal activi ty can be perpetuated under any provisions of law nor bene fit out of it. Law will miss its paramount object if it is not consistent with morality and any interpretation by courts cannot lead to a result where continuation of illegal activity or benefit attached to it is given recognition.

On appeal by the assessee, the Tribunal held that notwithstanding the ille gality of the transactions the loss could be set off and carried forward in accordance with the provisions of section 24(1) and 24(2) respectively of the Act. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the break up of losses in the busi ness of illegal forward contracts was as follows : ( 1 ) Groundnut oil Account Rs. 49,664/ (2) Groundnut Oil Account Rs., 22,522/ (3) Singdana (Groundnut seeds Account) at Veraval Rs. 2,162/ Total Rs. 73,348/\n",

            "Target: By a common order dated April 18, 1985 in C.A. No. 1423 of 1984, etc., Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros. the Court had directed issue of Export House Certificates and Addi tional Licences to the petitioners and other diamond export ers under the Import Policy 1978 79 stating: \"Save and except items which are specifically banned under the preva lent Import Policy at the time of import, the respondents shall be entitled to import all other items whether cana lised or otherwise in accordance with the relevant rules\". The petitioners, who were issued Additional Licences pursu ant to this order, imported several consignments of items falling under Appendices 2B, 3 and 5 of Import Policy, 1985 88, and, while clearing them, the Customs Authorities imposed a fine of Rs.45,000 in respect of certain items failing in Appendix 2B and issued show cause notices in respect of certain other items failing in Appendices 2B and 5. The petitioners challenge was directed not only against these orders, but extended to certain subsequent decisions of the Court which, according to them, had cut down the effect of the Court 's earlier order dated April 18, 1985 in Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros. Dismissing the petitions, HELD: The decisions rendered subsequent to the decision dated April 18, 1985 in Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros. do not take any different or contrary view. Indeed, they give effect to the letter and spirit of that decision. The basic background in which the decision in Union of India vs Rajni kant Bros. was rendered was that Export Houses had been refused Export House Certificates on the ground that they had not diversified their exports. It was found that was wrong. The wrong was undone by directing issue of Export House Certificates for 990 the year 1978 79 though the order was passed in April, 1985. That was a measure of restitution, but the Court, while doing so, ensured that nothing illegal was done. It is a presumption of law that the courts act lawfully and will not ask any authority to do anything which is illegal. It was directed that except those items which were specifically banned under the prevalent import policy at the time of import, the respondents therein were entitled to import all other items whether canalised or not canalised in accordance with the relevant rules. Analysing the said order, it is apparent: (1) that the importation that was permissible was of goods which were not specifically banned, (2) that such banning must be under the prevalent import policy at the time of import. and (3) whether items which were canalised or uncanalised would be imported in accordance with the relevant rules. These conditions had to be fulfilled. The court never did and could not have said that canalised items could be imported in any manner not permitted nor it could have given a go bye to the canalisation policy. [1000C H] (ii). In Raj Prakash Chemicals vs Union of India,, it was explained that only such items could be imported by diamond exporters under the Additional Licences granted to them as could have been imported under the Import Policy 1978 79 and were also importable under the Import Policy prevailing at the time of import. These were the items which had not been 'specifically banned ' under the prevalent Import Policy. The items had to pass through two tests, firstly, they should have been importable under the Import Policy 1978 79 and, secondly, they should also have been importable under the Import Policy, 1985 88 in terms of the Order dated 18th April, 1985 and if one may add, in such terms 'in accordance with the import rules ' whether cana lised or not canalised. The Court had no occasion to consid er in that case the significance of the words 'whether canalised or otherwise ' mentioned in the Order dated 18th April, 1985 in Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros., because that point did not arise there. [1000H; 1001A D] (iii) What did the court then intend by the words 'whet her canalised or otherwise ' used in the order dated 18th April, 1985 in Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros? The diamond exporters could import the items which they were entitled to import under the Import Policy 1978 79 provided they were importable also under the Import Policy ruling at the time of import. These are items which were open to import by Export Houses holding Additional Licences for Sale to the Actual Users (Industrial). These are items which were di rectly imported, for example, items in Part II List 8 of Appendix 6 of Import Policy 1985 88. These are items which are not canalised. Canalised items are those 991 items which are ordinarily open to import only through a public sector agency. Although generally these are import able through public sector agencies, it is permissible for any Import Policy to provide an exception to the rule and to declare that an importer might import a canalised item directly. It is in that sense and that sense only that the Court could have intended to define the entitlement of diamond exporters. They would be entitled to import items which were canalised or not if the Import Policy prevailing at the time of import permitted them to import items failing under such category. [1001D G] (iv) In the Order dated 18th April, 1985 in Union of India vs Rajnikant Bros., this Court did not do away with canalisation. That was not the issue before this Court. This expression 'whether canalised or not canalised ' was to include both. This Court did not say that canalised items could be imported directly by the importers ignoring the canalisation process. High public policy, it must be empha sised, is involved in the scheme of canalisation. This purpose of canalisation was examined by.this Court in Daruka of this Court observed that the policies of imports or exports were fashioned not only with reference to internal or international trade, but also on monetary policy, the development of agriculture and industries and even on the political policies of the country and rival theories and views may be held on such policies. If the Government decid ed an economic policy that import or export should be by a selected channel or through selected agencies, the court would proceed on the assumption that the decision was in the interest of the general public unless the contrary was shown. Therefore, it could not be collaterally altered in the manner suggested. The policy of canalisation which is a matter of policy of the Government was not given a go bye by the observations referred to in the Order of 18th April, 1985. Indeed, it is possible to read the Order in a manner consistent with canalisation scheme in the way we have indicated. If that is so, then it should be so read. When this Court observed that the fact whether items were sought to be imported by diamond merchants were canalised, would not be an impediment to the import directly by them, the Court meant to say that this could be imported directly by them through the canalisation organisation. The need for canalisation stands on public policy and that need cannot be lightly or inferentially given a go bye. It should not be presumed that collaterally the court had done away with the system of canalisation based on sound public policy. We have found nothing in the different authorities on this subject, which militate against the above views. Therefore, the action taken by the Customs Authorities in issuing adjudica tion notice and proceeding in 992 the manner they did we are of the opinion that they have not acted illegally or without jurisdiction. This must proceed in accordance with law as laid down by this Court which, in. our opinion is clear enough. The fact that in subsequent decision, the petitioner is not a party is not relevant. Generally legal positions laid down by the court would be binding on all concerned even though some of them have not been made parties nor were served nor any notice of such proceedings given.

Respondent No.1 Ex Chief Minister of Orissa, was alleged to have misappropriated a huge sum, said to have been col lected by District Congress Committees from various compa nies for publication of their advertisements in party 's souvenirs before the 1971 General Elections. A case was registered by the Vigilance Department against her and a charge sheet submitted. The Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate framed charges under ss.406,467,471 and 120 of the IPC. After the 1980 General Election, the State Government took a policy decision to withdraw cases against political leaders who were subjected to victimisation. The Special Public Prosecutor on being satisfied that the charge of criminal breach of trust would fail against respondent No.1 filed a petition under s.321 Cr. P.C. and sought the permis sion of the court in public interest for withdrawal of the case, when the case was posted for consideration of charge. After making an objective assessment of the merits of the application and being satisfied that the withdrawal of the prosecution would in no way affect any public interest or improve any public confidence the Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate granted consent to withdraw from the prosecution. The appellant 's revision petition having been dismissed by the High Court he appealed by special leave to this Court. Dismissing the appeal the Court, 692 HELD: Per Oza, J. (Bhagwati C.J.I. and Oza, J.) I. Once a charge has been framed against the accused on the basis that there was ground for presuming that he had committed the offence charged against him, the Public Prose cutor cannot make an application for withdrawal from the prosecution and the Magistrate cannot give his consent to such withdrawal on the ground that there was insufficient or no evidence to sustain the prosecution. [698H 699B] 2. The charge of criminal breach of trust framed against respondent No. 1, however, was totally groundless. There was nothing on record to indicate that the entrustment of funds to her was for the specific purpose of being utilised only for the purpose of publication of advertisements in the souvenirs. It was not the case of the prosecution that any of these amounts were handed over by any of the companies to her. The entrustment of these amounts, if at all, was to the souvenir committee of the All India Congress Committee and respondent No. 1 could not be charged for utilising any of these amounts for the purpose other than that for which it was entrusted to her. The charge against her, therefore, could not he sustained. [699E G] Instead of permitting the prosecution to he withdrawn under s.321 the charge framed against respondent No. 1 is quashed under s.239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. [699H 700A] Per Venkataramiah, J. I.I. Consent can he given under s.321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for withdrawal from the prosecution of a case at any time before the judgment is pronounced. The framing of the charge cannot be an impediment to give con sent to such withdrawal. In the instant case, the Public Prosecutor had applied his mind to the case before applying for withdrawal and the Chief Judicial Magistrate had not committed any error in giving his consent to such withdrawal. The order was, therefore, fully justified. The decision in State of Bihar vs Ram Naresh Pandey, , interpreting s.494 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and the decision in R.K. Jain vs State through Special Police Establishment & Ors., ; , interpreting s.321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 do not call for any reconsideration.[694C E] 693 Per Khalid, J. I. Order of withdrawal passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate is upheld. [695D] 2. Consent can be given under s.321 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for withdrawal from the prosecution of a case, not only when the charge is not framed but even after the charge is framed and at any time before the judgment. [694H 695A] 3. Section 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 is not attracted to the facts of the case for the propriety of the charge framed was not at issue.

[701G] 2. There is no material in the case to show that the Special Public Prosecutor was influenced by any improper motives for filing the application for withdrawal of the prosecution or that he had acted against his will at the behest of anyone else. The Additional Chief Judicial Magis trate had bestowed judicial consideration over the matter and had thereafter passed a reasoned order. Not only he but also the High Court had found after a careful scrutiny of relevant factors and circumstances, that the application for withdrawal of the prosecution made by the Special Public Prosecutor fully satisfied the tests laid down by the Su preme Court inasmuch as the Public Prosecutor had not exer cised his executive function improperly and also had not attempted to interfere with the normal course of justice for illegitimate reasons or purposes.

            "Target: The appellant Union, representing about 900 casual labourers falling under the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1971 some of whom formed Co operative societies and entered into contracts with the respondent refinery while others worked for contractors who had contracts with the refinery, filed a writ petition in this court claiming parity in wages and service conditions with the regular workmen of the respondent refinery. This Court disposed the petition by directing the Central Government to refer to the Industrial Tribunal for adjudication the questions whether the petitioners and some of the workmen whose services were terminated were employees of the refinery; whether their termination was justified and to what relief they were entitled to. The Government referred and the Tribunal decided the questions against the appellant union by holding that the labourers were employees of the contractors and not of the refinery and their termination was justified. But the Tribunal gave certain directions by way of relief for consideration by the Advisory Board about the desirability of continuance of the contract system in the refinery, for providing minimum pay of scale of regular employees to the contract labour and giving them preference in the regular employment. Against the award of the Industrial Tribunal, the Union filed an appeal in this Court praying for directions to the refinery to absorb and regularise the casual labourers in a phased manner.

The Magistrate attached the land and relegated the parties to a suit. The respondents filed a plaint seeking a declaration of their rights and removal of 'P 's name from the record of rights.

The first Appellate Court however decided in favour of 'P ' and on the basis of that finding 'P ' got possession from the criminal court.

The appellant 's case under section 20(b) of the Abolition Act therefore failed. [621A F] Amba Prasad vs Abdul Noor Khan & Ors., ; , referred to. 618 (ii) The appellants ' case under section 3 of U.P. Act 31 of 1952 also could not be sustained. To get the benefit of the section it had to be. established that P was in actual cultivatory possession of the land in 1359 F and that fact had not been established by direct evidence of possession, nor was it established by the entry relied on by him. A person who has no right to occupy land may rely upon his occupation against a third person who has no better title, but he cannot set up that right against the owner of the land. Section 3 conferred rights upon persons in possession of land against the tenure holders, it was not intended to put a premium upon forcible occupation of land by landless citizens. Possession of a person in wrongful occupation could not be deemed to be 'cultivatory possession ' within the meaning of the section. [622F 623F] Ram Krishna vs Bhagwan Baksh Singh, , ap proved. Nanhoo Mal V. Muloo and Ors., I.L.R. [1963] All. 751, disapproved. (iii) The High Court was not bound in the present case by the, findings of the first Appellate Court as the latter had ignored important evidence on record which proved that the entries relied on by 'P ' were not genuine. [623G] (iv) The High Court rightly granted to the respondents a decree for possession after allowing the respondents to add a prayer for possession to their plaint. When the High Court held in favour of the plaintiffs respondents and rejected the claim made by 'P ' it was justified and indeed bound, to avoid giving a fresh lease of life to the litigation and to make an order consistently with the rights declared by it, since 'P ' had during the pendency of the suit managed to obtain possession of the land from the Court Officer who was in possession of the land. A party who is defeated on the merits of the dispute! may not by securing an order from another court during the pendency of the suit be permitted to displace the jurisdiction of the civil court to try the suit which was within its competence when the suit was filed.

            "Target: % Section 14(1) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1959 requires dealers to furnish returns within such period and to such authority as may be prescribed. Rule 10(2) of the Bihar Sales Tax Rules, 1959 requires the assessee to file quarterly returns within one calendar month of the expiry of the period to which they relate. Sub section (3) of section 14 provides for extension of time for submission of the return. Subsection (2) of section 20 requires dealers to pay into the Government Treasury the full amount of tax due and furnish a receipt along with the return. Section 15 entitles the assessee to rebate in tax on returns furnished under sub section (1) of section 14 or within extended period. The proviso to sub section (2) of section 20 entitles a dealer to deduct from the amount of tax due from him any amount which may be admissible as rebate under the provisions of section 15. The assessee filed its quarterly returns under section 14(1) of the Act late by a few days. There was no application made by it to the prescribed authority for extension of time. The assessee, however, paid the tax before the due date of the respective returns and availed itself of the rebate by deducting the same while paying the tax due. The Tribunal held that as the assessee did not file its returns within the prescribed period and had sought no extension, it was not entitled to the rebate. The High Court upheld the view taken by the Tribunal. Allowing the appeal, 149 ^ HELD: 1. The assessee was entitled to the rebate of tax provided for in section 15 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1959. [156B] 2. The condition in section 15 referring to a return has a substantive as well as procedural content. The latter should be construed somewhat liberally and generously so long as the principal object of the provision is not frustrated. [155H; 156A] C.I.T. vs Kulu Valley Transport Co. Pvt. Ltd., ; Gursahai Saigal vs C.l. T. [1963] 48 I.T.R. S.C. 1; Allen vs Trehearne, and C.I.T. vs Mahaliram Ramjidas, referred to. 3.1 The object of section 15 of the Act is to confer a benefit on an assessee for prompt payment of the tax. In the instant case, the assessee had paid the tax before the due dates. The tax paid accords with the tax due on the basis of returns. There was short delay only in the filing of the returns. [153D E] 3.2 The Act does not set out any particular procedure for obtaining extention of time. It does not prescribe any form of application. It does not require that the prescribed authority must pass an order recording his satisfaction that the time should be extended and granting time. it envisages three consequences to the assessee for failure to file a return within the prescribed time, or extended time: (i) loss of rebate under section 15, (ii) risk of a penalty under section 14(4), and (iii) risk of a best judgment assessment under section 16(4). [154A D] 3.3 In the instant case the assessing authority has neither levied a penalty nor made a best judgment assessment nor recorded a finding that the delay was without reasonable cause. From these circumstances it is reasonable to infer that the returns, though filed belatedly, have been accepted and acted upon by the prescribed authority. An extention of time can thus be inferred from the attendant circumstances of the case. [154D F] 3.4 The condition precedent for the grant of rebate that the assessee should have filed its return within the prescribed or extended period, can, therefore, be said to have been fulfilled in the present case.

The prescribed authority is the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax who is also the assessing authority. The assessee however, paid the taxes before the due dates of the respective returns, availed itself of the rebate and deducted the same while paying the tax due on the returns filed by it. In the present case, the assessee filed its quarterly returns under section 14 (1) of the Act but, except for the second quarter of 196061, the returns were all filed belatedly. The High Court held that there was no application made by the appellant to the prescribed authority for extension of the time prescribed under the Act for the filing of the return.

            "Target: The appellant company, a member of Cooperative Society, respondent No. 2, was having its office premises in a build ing owned by respondent No. 2. It entered into an agreement to sell the said premises to respondent No. 1, a non member subject to the approval of the Cooperative Society. The Cooperative Society declined to grant permission for trans fer of the premises. Respondent No. 1 filed a dispute against the appellant and respondent No. 2 Cooperative Society in the Cooperative Court under section 91 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960 praying for a decree of specific performance of the contract and a direc tion to the Cooperative Society to approve the said agree ment. The Cooperative Court dismissed the dispute for want of jurisdiction. On appeal by respondent No. 1, the Maharashtra Cooperative Appellate Court set aside the order of the Cooperative Court. Against the order of the Cooperative Appellate Court, the appellant filed a writ petition in the High Court which was dismissed by holding that the dispute was governed by Section 91 of the Act. In the appeal to this Court against the Judgment of the High Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the dispute between the parties was not governed by Section 91 since it was neither a dispute \"touching the business of the society\" nor was it a dispute between a person claiming through a member against the society. 467 Allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment of the High Court, this Court, HELD: 1. Before a dispute can be referred to a Coopera tive Court under the provision of section 91(1) of the said Act it is not only essential that the dispute should be of a kind described in sub section (1) of section 91 but it is also essential that the parties to the said dispute must belong to any of the categories specified in clauses (a) to (e) of subsection (1) of the said section. [473B] 2. In the instant case the main claim of Respondent No. 1 a nonmember, was for a decree for specific performance of the agreement. The prayer for an order that respondent No. 2 Society should be directed to give their approval to the said agreement was merely an ancillary prayer made with a view to complete the relief of specific performance. The main claim to have the agreement specifically performed cannot be said to be a claim made by a person (non member) against the Society. The claim against the society cannot be said to be made through a member, the appellant, because it is only when a decree for performance of the said agreement is passed against the appellant, that it could be contended that the other relief namely, for an order directing re spondent No. 2 to approve the said agreement is claimed against the society through a member. Consequently, the dispute cannot be said to fall within the scope of section 91(1)(b) of the Act. Therefore, the High Court committed an error in coming to the conclusion that both the parties to the dispute belonged to the categories covered under section 91(1)(b) of the Act.

Rule 2(1) designates the officer having powers to make substantive appointments to the post as the 'appropriate authority '. Rule 12.1 categorises Superintendents of Police as the authority competent to make appointments to the non gazetted ranks of Sub Inspectors and Assistant Sub Inspectors. Rule 13.9(2) empowers Deputy Inspector General of Police to make substantive promotions to the rank of Assistant Sub Inspec tor in accordance with r. 13.1. The respondent who was working as Sub Inspector of Police was compulsorily retired by an order dated 24th September, 1975 issued by the Senior Superintendent of Police. He was earlier suspended from service with effect from 5th September, 1974. A suit filed by him for a declara tion that the said order was illegal, mala fide, unconstitu tional, and against the rules of natural justice was dis missed by the trial court holding that the impugned order was not vitiated by any malice or mala fides, having been innocuously made in public interest, and decreed the suit in part for the arrears of salary for the suspension period. Both the State and the respondent preferred appeals. The appellate court allowing the respondent 's appeal, held that the order of compulsory retirement was made by an officer who was below the rank of Inspector General of Police, the 'appointing authority ' of the petitioner, and that the judgment and decree as regards the payment of balance of emoluments for the period of suspension after the reinstatement was legal and valid and dismissed the appeal filed by the State. The High Court dismissed the second appeal preferred by the State. 504 Allowing the State 's appeal by special leave in part, the Court, HELD: In view of the specific provision made in role 12.1 of the Punjab Civil Services (Premature Retirement) Rules, 1975 that the Superintendent of Police is competent to make the appointment to the non gazetted ranks of Sub Inspectors of Police, the contention that only the Deputy Inspector General of Police was competent to make the im pugned order cannot be sustained. [507G] Rule 12.1 read with rule 13.9(2) makes it dear and apparent that the Senior Superintendent of Police was legal ly competent to make the order of compulsory retirement of a Sub Inspector of Police from service in public interest after attaining 50 years of age, in accordance with the provisions of rule 3(1) (a) and (b) of the Rules. The order of retirement made in the instant case, was, therefore, legal and valid.

            "Target: In order to avoid the charge of vindictiveness, justice, equity and fairplay demand that punishment must always be commensurate with the gravity of the offence charged. In the development of industrial relation norms law has moved far from the days when quantum of punishment was considered a managerial function with the courts having no power to substitute their own decision in place of that of the management. More often, the courts found that, while the misconduct was proved, the punishment was disproportionately heavy. As the situation then stood, courts remained powerless and had to be passive sufferers incapable of curing the injustice. Parliament stepped in and enacted section IIA of the Industrial Disputes Act by which the Labour Court is clothed with jurisdiction and power to substitute its measure of punishment in place of the managerial wisdom once it is satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified in the facts and circumstances of the case. This Court, while exercising jurisdiction under Article 136 can examine whether the Labour Court has properly approached the matter in exercising or refusing to exercise its power under section 11A. The words that the court must be \"satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified\" occurring in section 11A indicate that even though misconduct is proved and a penalty has to be imposed, the extreme penalty of dismissal or discharge was not justified in the facts and circumstances of the case meaning thereby that the punishment was either disproportionately heavy or excessive. In the instant case the charge against the appellant workman was that he had used threatening and abusive language against a senior officer unbecoming of a disciplined workman and had adopted a threatening posture, subversive of discipline. An inquiry was conducted. On the recommendations of the Inquiry officer the workman was dismissed from service. The Labour Court upheld the order of dismissal and the High Court dismissed the appellant 's petition under Article 227. 649 On the question whether the order of dismissal was justified on the facts and in the circumstances of the case. ^ HELD: The order of dismissal was not justified. [653 A] It is a well recognized principle of jurisprudence, which permits penalty to be imposed for misconduct, that the penalty must be commensurate with the gravity of the offence charged. [653 C D] The appellant workman had put in more than 14 years of service and had been the Secretary of the workers ' union. The management had not shown that there was any blameworthy conduct on his part during the period of his service. The misconduct alleged against him consisted of use of language which was indiscreet and improper, disclosing a threatening posture. [653 E F] When it is said that his language disclosed a threatening posture it was the subjective conclusion of the person who heard the language because voice modulation of each person in the society differs. Indiscreet, improper, abusive language may show lack of culture. But mere use of such language on one occasion unconnected with any subsequent positive action and not preceded by any blameworthy conduct cannot permit an extreme penalty of dismissal from service.

He was served with the grounds of detention on the same day. The petitioner 's advocate wrote a letter dated September 7, 1979 to the detaining authority second respondent stating that it was not possible to make an effective representation without the copies of statements and documents referred to in detention order. The detaining authority did not take any action on the letter but forwarded it to the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India who by a communication dated September 10, 1979 acknowledged its receipt and requested the advocate to contact the Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement, Bombay regarding the supply of copies of statements and documents. As no further communication was received, the advocate addressed a letter dated September 14, 1979 to the Deputy Director to supply him copies of the statements and documents. The Deputy Director in his communication dated September 22, 1979 requested the advocate to see him on September 24, 1979 to take inspection of the documents. On inspecting the documents the advocate was not satisfied and insisted on supply of copies of documents, which were supplied on three days, September 26, 1979, September 28, 1979 and September 29, 1979. On October 5, 1979 the petitioner made his representation against the detention. In the writ petition, it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that as there was unreasonable delay in furnishing of the statements and documents referred to in the grounds of detention and the right to make an effective representation was denied, the detention could not be said to be according to the procedure prescribed by law. On behalf of the detaining authority it was contended that the constitutional right of the petitioner to make an effective representation had not been infringed and that it was not incumbent upon the detaining authority to supply copies of all documents relied upon in the grounds of detention and that the grounds of detention were sufficiently detailed so as to enable the petitioner to make an effective representation against the detention. Allowing the petition, ^ HELD: 1. The detaining authority failed to act with reasonable expedition in furnishing the statements and documents referred to in the grounds of detention. The detention is therefore not in accordance with the procedure contemplated under law, and the continued detention is not warranted. [1077G] 2. It is settled law that the appropriate authority is bound to give an opportunity to the detenu to make representation and to consider the representation 1073 of the detenu as early as possible.

In order to make an effective representation, the detenu is entitled to obtain information relating to the grounds of detention. When the grounds of detention are served on the detenue he is entitled to ask for copies of the statements and documents referred to in the grounds of detention to enable him to make an effective representation. When the detenu makes a request for such documents, they should be supplied to him expeditiously. [1075E] (ii) When the Act contemplates the furnishing of grounds of detention within five days of the order of detention, the intention is clear that the statements and documents which are referred to in the grounds of detention and which are required by the detenu should be furnished with reasonable expedition. [1076B] 4. If there is undue delay in furnishing the statements and documents referred to in the grounds of detention the right to make an effective representation is denied. It is the duty of the detaining authority to satisfactorily explain the delay, if any, in furnishing of the documents. [1076A, 1075G] 5. It may not be necessary for the detaining authority to supply copies of the documents relied upon in the grounds of detention at the time when the ground are furnished to the detenu but once the detenu states that for effective representation it is necessary that he should have copies of the statements and documents referred to in the grounds of detention it is the duty of the detaining authority to furnish them with reasonable expedition. The detaining authority cannot decline to furnish copies of the documents on the ground that the grounds were sufficiently detailed to enable the petitioner to make an effective representation.

The assessee filed writ petitions alleging that the assessment orders were without jurisdiction on several grounds. The High Court allowed the writ petitions holding that section 9 of the as it stood at the relevant time cast a liability to tax only on a 'registered dealer ' and not an 'unregistered dealer '. In the appeals it was contended on behalf of the Department that by virtue of section 9 of the Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1976, cl. (b) of the proviso to section 9(1) of the was deemed to have been in force since 5.1.57 and, therefore, the position was as if the Act had always imposed a liability to pay tax even on unregistered dealers just as it had originally done on registered dealers, and that the amendment only affected the venue of taxation, and being procedural in nature, it was required to be construed retrospectively, Dismissing the appeals, ^ HELD: 1. Clause (b) of section 9(1) of the is operative only from 7.9.76. [573] The instant case is, therefore, governed by the earlier provision, and the respondent assessee being an unregistered dealer is not liable to pay tax. [573D] State vs Kasturi Lal Har Lal, [1987] 67 STC 154 SC, relied on. 563 2.1 Where the statute, Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1976, on its face, clearly indicates retrospective effect where intended, there can be no justification to read retrospectivity into the amendment made by cl. (c) of section /6 of the Amending Act, which does not contain any words to that effect. [571D] 2.2 The language of the validation section clearly concerns only penalties which are dealt with under section 9(2). The amending Act refers to section 9 in general and not to section 9(2) only because section 9(1) also contains a reference to sub section (2). From this circumstance alone it cannot be inferred that retrospectivity to the amendment of section 9(1) also is intended. [572C D] 2.3 The employment of word \"also\" cannot be treated as an indication of intention by the Legislature that the amendment of section 9(1) by section 6 of the Amending Act was to be effective from 5.1.57. If the Legislature had intended it, the intention could and would have been expressed clearly in cl. (a) of section 6 itself as it had been in the other clauses and in the other sections. If section 9(1) of the Amendment Act had been inserted as cl. (d) in section 6 thereof, it could not have changed the prospective effect of cl. The position is not different merely because this provision is contained in section 9 and not section 6 of the Amendment Act. Section 9(1) of the Amendment Act talks only of reading these extra words into section 9(1) of the Principal Act between 5.1.57 and 7.9.76. It does not contain any operative words that require section 9(1) of the Principal Act being read in the form in which it has been amended by section 6 during that earlier period. [572E G] All that the provision requires is that for the period 5.1.57 to 7.9.76, the section is to be read as if it also included the additional substantive provisions referred to therein. It was earlier not clear whether all these provisions could be read into the section before 7.9.76, the date when the amendment Act came into force. So, the validation section declares that the section should be read, even earlier, as if it comprehended also these substantive provisions. It is in this context that the word \"also\" is used. [572D E] 2.4 The question whether a charge to tax can be imposed in one State or another is not a mere question of venue. It may have an impact on the rate of tax in certain cases and it also regulates the rights inter se of States to levy taxes on such inter state sales. [573B C] The amendment changes the position that an unregistered dealer 564 is not taxable under the proviso and imposes a substantive liability on such a dealer. It is also one which confers jurisdiction on an officer in a particular State to levy a tax which he otherwise cannot. It is thus a substantive provision. [573B] The amendment cannot, therefore, be treated as purely procedural and hence necessarily retrospective.

As a result of this shot the deceased was killed instantaneously and one of the witnesses sustained injuries. The defence version, on the other hand, was that on the date and time of the occurrence when the two accused were going out of the village the deceased, his servant and the injured witness assaulted them and on hearing their cries, the respondent 's father fired at the deceased in self defence and that this had resulted in the death of the deceased and injury to the witness. The trial court found him guilty of the offence punishable under section 302 I.P.C. and sentenced him to death and the co accused with imprisonment for life. Before the High Court the argument for the respondent was that since the injuries on the person of the witness were superficial, he could have been fired at only from a long distance and being an aged man of 60 years, he could not have run and caught hold of the respondent before the respondent could reload his gun. To test the capacity of the witness to run and to assess the time taken in reloading a gun, the High Court conducted an experiment by asking the witness, who was present in the court, to move briskly to a certain distance. A young lawyer present in the Court was asked to unload and reload a gun exactly of the same make as the gun used by the respondent. On the basis of this experiment the High Court came to the conclusion that 295 even if the witness, after receiving gun shot injuries had run some distance towards the respondent; he could neither have caught hold of him nor could he have prevented him from reloading his gun. Disbelieving the prosecution story, the High Court acquitted both the accused. The State 's Special Leave Petition against the judgment of the High Court was granted only with respect to the respondent. On the question whether the High Court was correct in conducting the experiment that it did and in coming to the conclusion that the respondent was not guilty of the offence of murder. Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The procedure of conducting an experiment in Court two years after the incident with the aid of a young lawyer (about whose proficiency in handling a gun there is no authentic evidence) who was asked to handle a different gun altogether and using the conclusion based on that experiment to reject the truth of the evidence of the eye witness, was highly irregular. The High Court has not addressed itself to the degree of efficiency or inefficiency of the respondent in handling a gun. The time taken by any person to reload a gun depends upon several factors, including the condition of the gun and the surcharged atmosphere created by the firing bout which may have preceded the time of reloading the gun. [301 F H] Ordinarily, this Court would not interfere with the judgment of acquittal on mere re appreciation of evidence. But if there are glaring infirmities in the judgment of the High Court resulting in miscarriage of justice it is the duty of this Court to interfere. [309 F G] In the instant case the High Court was wrong in conducting the experiment carried out by it at the hearing of the appeal. Having been impressed by its result it first rejected the evidence of the eye witness on trivial omissions which would not affect the credibility of the prosecution version on imaginary grounds. From the evidence it is obvious that the two accused were armed with fire arms and were the aggressors. On a careful reading of the evidence, it is clear that the father of the accused respondent, out of love and affection towards his son, tried to shield him. [306 F G] The plea of self defence cannot be accepted. A person who was an aggressor and who sought an attack on himself by his own aggressive attack cannot rely upon the right of self defence if in the course of the transaction he deliberately kills another whom he had attacked earlier. Having regard to the nature of the weapon used, the act by which death was caused by the respondent was done with the intention of causing death and there were no extenuating circumstances which would mitigate the offence committed by him.

The acquittal of the co accused did not effect the prosecution case against him. There is no legal bar for convicting the respondent alone in this case on the facts and circumstances of the case. The principle of issue estoppel is inapplicable here. [309 D E] \n",

The arbitrator, to whom the question of compensation was referred, awarded compensation of Rs. 2,581, 8 0 according to the rent prevailing in the locality for similar buildings with similar accommodation and amenities. This included an additional award of 10%` for the potentialities of the premises consisting of the special value of the premises for the Controller, the indefinite period of the requisition and additional burden on the lift. On appeal by the appellant the 923 High Court held the compensation to be Rs. 2,773/ per mensem. It rejected the additional award of 10% for potential value. Held, that the High Court was wrong in ignoring the poten tial value of the premises which had been evaluated at 10% by the arbitrator. The principles for the award of compensation are the same under section 19 Defence of India Act as under section 23 Land Acquisition Act, and one of them is to evaluate the potentialities of the premises which differ under different circumstances. Such value is to be ascertained by the arbitrator as best as he can from the materials before him.

This sum was to be paid as from August 1, 1943. The appellant took an appeal to the High Court who fixed the compensation at Rs. 16 per hundred sq.m.

The landlords moved an application under section 21 of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 against the tenant and the sub tenant for release of the premises on the ground of bonafide requirement. The prescribed authority allowed the application against the appellant and dismissed against the tenant. In appeal the District judge confirmed the order of the prescribed authority. In a writ petition the appellant challenged the order of the District Judge. The High Court dismissed the writ petition observing that the fourth proviso to s.21 contemplated the consideration of the likely hardship of the tenant or the landlord only and not of the sub tenant. Hence this appeal. Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: All that the relevant proviso to s.21 requires is that the comparative hardship of the tenant as also that of the landlord shall be taken into account before passing any order of release or refusal to release. If the sub tenancy had been created without the consent of the landlord the position might have been different. The sub tenant for the purposes of the fourth proviso to s.21 would virtually be a tenant inasmuch as rent is payable by him to the tenant in chief, who to all intents and purposes will be a landlord qua the sub tenant: To interpret the section in the way as the High Court has interpreted would be defeating the very salutary purpose of the Act.

            "Target: In 1959 the landlord filed an application under section 3(1) of the U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent & Eviction Act, 1947 for the eviction of the tenant from the shop on the ground that the landlord wanted to demolish the shops in the building including the shop of the appellant/ tenant and in their place wanted to construct new shops and residential portion on the first floor. In the application the landlord gave an assurance (undertaking) that he would give new shop to the tenant/appellant after the new shops were construct ed, at a reasonable rent. This application was contested by the appellant/tenant alongwith other tenants. The applica tion was made to the District Magistrate u/s 2(d) of the U .P. Rent Act, 1947. The Rent Controller and Eviction Officer who acted as District Magistrate under the said Act granted the permission and rejected the contentions of the tenants. Against this decision all the tenants filed revi sion petitions which were dismissed by the commissioner Rohilkhand Division, Bareilly. The tenants preferred further revision to the State Govt. u/s 7 F of the said Act. In disposing of the revision petitions the Special Secretary noted that the landlord had given an undertaking to the tenants that they would he given newly constructed shops on standard rent and that during the period taken for construc tion alternative accommodation would he given to them. Thereafter the landlord filed a suit on the basis of the, permission for eviction of the tenants. During the pendency of the suit the U.P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 came into force. The U.P. Rent Act of 1947 was repealed and some amendments were made to section 43(2)(rr) in the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 whereby the landlords who had on the basis of permission granted to them u/s 3(1) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 instituted suits for the eviction of the tenants were given the right to apply for eviction of their tenants straightaway if the permission granted to them under section 3(1) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 had been obtained on any ground 561 specified in sub section (1) or subsection (2) of section 21 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972. Taking advantage of these provisions, the landlord filed an application for an order of eviction u/s 43(2)(rr) of the U.P. Rent Act 1972. The Prescribed Authority dismissed the application of the land lord on the ground that the permission obtained by him was conditional permission and it would come into operation when the landlord had complied with the offer made by him and until then he could not claim eviction of the tenant u/s 43(2)(rr) of the U.P. Rent Act, 1972. Against that order the landlord preferred a writ petition in the High Court of Allahabad. The High Court took the view that the Prescribed Authority was bound to allow the application of the landlord u/s 43(2) (rr) and order eviction. Against this judgment the tenant appellant came up by way of special leave. In setting aside the order of the High Court, this Court in allowing the appeal, HELD: One of the circumstances which constituted the basis for the grant of the permission to tile the suit for eviction was that the landlord gave an assurance cum under taking to give the newly constructed shops to the tenants sought to he evicted including the tenant in the appeal and that the landlord also gave a similar assurance to give alternative accommodation to the tenant during the period which would he taken in completing the new construction. Nothing is found in the provisions of Section 43(2)(rr) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 which would enable the landlord to evade his duty to comply with the undertaking cum assurances given by him. The undertaking cum assurances given by the landlord in the instant case certainly formed part of the basis on which the permission to file suit for eviction was unconditionally given to him. It is but fair that the Court should see to it that the tenant is not deprived of the benefit of the undertakings cum assurances. [566G, 567F] Asa Singh vs B.D.

            "Target: The prosecution case was that the appellant, a non resident Indian at Dubai, hatched a conspiracy along with four others to cheat the Bank at Chandigarh. in furtherance of the conspiracy, the appellant got credit facility by way of Foreign Letters of Credit and issued proforma invoices of his concern and addressed to the Bank through the establishments of other accused. The Manager of the Bank, another accused, in confabulation with 544 the appellant and other accused, being in charge of foreign exchange department, issued Foreign letter of Credit in violation of import policy. The Bills of Lading were addressed to the Bank. The cable confirmation of the Bank was sent to appellant 's concern at Dubai for confirmation of discrepancy. The appellant confirmed correctness thereof. Placing reliance thereon, authority letter was issued by the Bank and cables were sent subsequent thereto to remit the amount . to the Dubai Bank through one Irving Trust Company, At the instance of accused Anand, The Dubai Bank informed the Bankat Chandigarh that the discrepancy in the document adaptable to accused Anand and claimed to have inspected the goods on board in the vessel. On receipt of the information from the appellant 's concern at Dubai, full amount is US Dollars 4,39,200 was credited against all the three Letters of Credit on discount basis. The investigation established that the vessel was a non existent one and three Foreign Letters of Credit were fabricated on the basis of false and forged shipping documents submitted by the appellant to the Dubai Bank. Thus the Bank at Chandigarh was cheated of an amount of Rs. 40,30,329. The accused were charge sheeted under section read with sections 420, 468, and 471, IPC. The Trial Court discharged all the accused of the offenses on the ground that conspiracy and the acts done in furtherance thereof had taken place outside India and as no sanction under section 188, Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 was produced, the prosecution was not maintainable. The High Court in revision held that the conspiracy took place at Chandigarh and the overt acts committed In pursuance of that conspiracy at Dubai constituted offences under sections 420,467 and 471 IPC., and they were triable at Chandigarh without previous sanction of the Central Govt. The High Court setting aside the order of discharge of the trial Court, directed to continue further proceedings in accordance with law. That order of the High Court was challenged under this appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution. The appellant contended that he was not a privy to the conspiracy and the conspiracy did not take place at Chandigarh; and that even assuming that some of the offences were committed in India, by operation of section 188 read with the proviso thereto with a non obstanti clause, absence of sanction by the 545 Central Govt. barred the jurisdiction of the Courts in India to take cognisance of or to enquire into or try the accused. The respondents submitted that the conspiracy to cheat the Bank was hatched at Chandigarh; that all the accused committed over acts in furtherance of the conspiracy at Chandigarh and therefore, the sanction of the Central Govt. was not necessary. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: Per K. Ramaswarmy, J. 1.01. Judicial power of a State extends to the punishment of all offences against the municipal laws of the State by whomsoever committed within the territory. It also has the power to punish all such offences wherever committed by its citizen. The general principle of international law is that every person be it a citizen or foreigner who is found within a foreign State is subjected to, and is punishable by, its law. Otherwise the criminal law could not be administered according to any civilised system of jurisprudence. (553F) 1.02. Conspiracy may he considered to be a march under a banner and a person may join or drop out in the march without the necessity of the change in the text on the banner. In the comity of International Law, in these days, commiting offences on international scale is a common feature. The offence of conspiracy would be a useful weapon and there would exist no contact in municipal laws and the doctrine of autrefois convict or acquit would extend to such offences. The comity of nations are duty bound to apprehend the conspirators as soon as they set their feet on the country territorial limits and nip the offence in the bud. (564 F G) 2.01. Section 120 A of the I.P.C. defines 'conspiracy ' to mean that when two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done an illegal act, or an act which is not illegal by illegal means such an agreement is designated as criminal conspiracy\". No agreement except an agreement to commit an offence shall amount to a criminal conspiracy, unless some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in furtherance thereof. (557 C) 546 2.02. Section 120 B of the I.P.C. prescribes punishment for criminal conspiracy. It is not necessary that each conspirator must know all the details of the scheme nor be a participant at every state. It is necessary that they should agree for design or object of the conspiracy. Conspiracy is conceived as having three elements: (1) agreement (2) between two or more persons by whom the agreement is effected; and (3) a criminal object, which may be either the ultimate aim of the agreement, or may constitute the means, or one of the means by which that aim is to be accomplished. It is immaterial whether this is found in the ultimate objects. (554 E) 2.03. Conspiracy to commit a crime itself is punishable as a substantive offence and every individual offence committed pursuant to the conspiracy is separate and distinct offence to which individual offenders are liable to punishment, independent of the conspiracy. (556 D) 2.04. The agreement does not come to an end with it . making, but would endure till it is accomplished or abandoned or proved abortive. Being a continuing offence, if any acts or omissions which constitute an offence are done in India or outside its territory the conspirators continuing to be parties to the conspiracy and since part of the acts were done in India, they would obviate the need to obtain sanction of the Central Govt. All of them need not he present in India nor continue to remain in India. (556 E) 2.05. An agreement between two or more persons to do an illegal act or legal acts by illegal means is criminal conspiracy. If the agreement is not an agreement to commit an offence, it does not amount to conspiracy unless it is followed up by an overt act done by one or more persons in furtherance of the agreement. The offence is complete as soon as there is meeting of minds and unity of purpose between the conspirators to de that illegal act or legal act by illegal means. Conspiracy itself is a substantive offence and is distinct from the offence to commit which the conspiracy is entered into. It is undoubted that the general conspiracy is distinct from number of separate offences committed while executing the offence of conspiracy. Each act constitutes separate offence punishable, independent of the conspiracy. (563 F G) \"Jones 'Case, 1832 B & A D 345; Mulcahy vs Reg., (1868) L.R. ; Quinn vs Leathem, ; at 528; B.G.

A conspiracy is a continuing offence and continues to subsist and committed wherever one of the conspirators does an act or series of facts. So long as it ; performance continues, it is a continuing offence till it is executed or rescinded or frustrated by choice or necessity A crime is complete as soon as the agreement is made, but it is not a thing of the moment It does not end with the making of the agreement. It will continue so long as there are two or more parties to it intending to carry into effect the design. Its continuance is a threat to the society against which it was aimed at and would be dealt with as soon as that jurisdiction can properly claim the power to do so. The conspiracy designed or agreed abroad will have the same effect as in India,. when part of the acts, pursuant to the agreement are agreed to be finalised or done, attempted or even frustrated and vice versa.

Sahai, J. (Concurring) 1.1. Language of the section 188, Code of Criminal Procedure is plain and simple. It operates where an offence is committed by a citizen of India outside the country. Requirements are, therefore, one commission of an offence; second by an Indian citizen; and third that it should have been committed outside the country. (567 D) 1.2. Substantive law of extra territory in respect of criminal offences is provided for by Section 4 of the IPC and the procedure to inquire and try it is contained in Section 1 88 Cr. P.C. Effect of these sections is that an offence committed by an Indian citizen outside the country is deemed to have been committed in India. (567 E) 1.3. Since the proviso to Section 188, Cr. P.C. begin . with a non obstinate clause its observance is mandatory. But it would come into play only if the principal clause is applicable, namely, it is established that an offence as defined in dause 'n 'of Section 2 of the Cr. P.C. has been committed and it has been committed outside the country. (567 G) 549 1.4. What has to be examined at this stage is if the claim of the appellant that the offence under Section 120B read with Section 420 and Section 471 of the IPC were committed outside the country. An offence is deemed in the Cr. P.C. to mean an Act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force. None of the offences for which the appellant has been charged has residence as one of its ingredients. (567 H, 568 A) 1.5. The jurisdiction to inquire or try vests under Section 177 in the Court in whose local jurisdiction the offence is committed. It is thus the commission of offence and not the residence of the accused which is decisive of jurisdiction. When two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done an illegal act or an act which is illegal by illegal means such agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy under Section 120A of the IPC. The ingredients of the offence is agreement and not the residence. Meeting of minds of more than two persons is the primary requirement Even if it is assumed that the appellant was at Dubai and he entered into an agreement with his counterpart sifting in India to do an illegal act in India the offence of conspiracy came into being when agreement was reached between the two. The two minds met when talks oral or in writing took place in India. Therefore, the offence of conspiracy cannot be said to have been committed outside the country. (568 B C) 1.6. If a foreign national is amenable to jurisdiction under Section 179 of the Cr. P.C. a NRI cannot claim that the offence shall be deemed to have been committed outside the country merely because he was not physically present (568 F) Mobarik Ali Ahmed vs The State of Bombay, ; , referred to. An offence is committed when all the ingredients are satisfied. The section having used the word 'offence ' it cannot be understood as part of the offence. Section 179 Cr. P.C. empowers a court to try an offence either at a place where the offence is committed or the consequences ensue. On the allegations in the complaint the act or omissions were committed in India. In any case the consequence of conspiracy, cheating and forging having taken place at Chandigarh the offence was not committed outside the country therefore the provisions of Sec. 188 Cr. P.C. were not attracted. (569 B) \n",

            "Target: The appellant, an officer of the Forest Department challenged the provisional integrated gradation list of Forest Officers of the former Andhra and Hyderabad States published under the provisions of the States Reorganisation Act, 1947, in his writ petition, contending that (a) the inter se seniority between the appellant and the 6th respondent, both of whom originally belonged to the Andhra Cadre, had been wrongly fixed by showing the 6th respondent as senior to the appellant whereas the appellant was legally entitled to seniority over the 6th respondent, and (b) that respondent nos. 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 officers allotted to the State of Andhra Pradesh from the Telengana region of the former Hyderabad State, had been erroneously assigned ranks above the appellant in violation of the principles laid down by the Government of India for equation of posts and fixation of inter se seniority. During the pendency of the writ petition the Central Government set right the appellant 's grievance concerning his ranking and seniority in relation to respondents 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8. When the writ petition came up for hearing the appellant pressed only his claim for seniority over the 6th respondent and as the contention was well founded, the learned Single Judge, allowed the writ petition and issued a writ of mandamus directing the Government of India to modify the gradation list by showing the appellant as senior to the 6th respondent. In the appeal to the Division Bench by the 6th respondent, the Division Bench took the view that since the prayer contained in the writ the petition was for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing respondents nos. 1 and 2 to forbear from implementing the provisional gradation list published alongwith the Government Order dated January 27, 1962 and as the appellant had not pressed the prayer for quashing of the list in so far as it related to the officers of Telengana region viz. respondents 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, the writ petition should have been dismissed on that short ground and the question relating to the inter se seniority between the appellant and the 6th respondent ought not to have been decided. The Division Bench allowed the writ appeal, set aside the order passed by the single Judge and dismissed the writ petition. Allowing the appeal to this Court, 160 ^ HELD: In an action where a party has prayed for a larger relief it is always open to the Court to grant him any smaller relief that he may be found to be entitled to in law and thereby render substantial justice. The Court can take note of changed circumstances and suitably mould the relief to be granted to the party concerned in order to mete out justice. As far as possible the anxiety and endeavour of the Court should be to remedy an in justice when it is brought to its notice rather than deny relief to an aggrieved party on purely technical and narrow procedural grounds. [162 G 163 A] In the instant case the writ petition contained the prayer for the quashing of the gradation list in so far as it related to the inter se ranking of the appellant vis a vis respondents nos. 3 to 8 and the appellant had also sought the issuance of a writ of mandamus directing respondents nos. 1 and 2 to forbear from implementing or acting upon the said gradation list. Subsequent to the institution of the writ petition the Central Government had refixed the ranks of respondents nos. 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 and placed them below the appellant thereby redressing the grievance of the appellant in so far as it pertained to the ranking of the said respondents. It, therefore, became unnecessary for the appellant to pursue his claim for relief with respect to the ranks assigned to those five respondents. It was under those circumstances that the appellant submitted before the single Judge at the time of final hearing of the writ petition that he was pressing the writ petition only in so far as it related to his claim for seniority over the 6th respondent. This will not operate to preclude him from seeking a lesser relief namely the quashing of the list only in so far as it pertains to the fixation of the inter se seniority between himself and the 6th respondent. [162 B F] \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant, who was working as an officer of the Forest Department in the State of Andhra Pradesh, approached the High 161 Court challenging the provisional integrated gradation list published under the provisions of the States Reorganization Act, as annexure to a State Government order dated January 27, 1962. By the time the writ petition came up for hearing before the learned single judge, the Central Government had already set right the appellant's grievance concerning his ranking and the seniority in relation to respondents 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8. It therefore became unnecessary for him to pursue the second contention of the appellant that he was entitled to seniority over the 6th respondent. Accordingly, the learned Single judge found that the contention put forward by the appellant was well founded and dismissed the petition. The appellant filed a writ petition before a Division Bench of the High Court questioning the legality and correctness of the aforesaid reasoning and conclusion of the Division Bench. It was contended that since the prayer contained\n",

            "Target: The respondent company, which was incorporated in New York and carried on business in spices, brought a suit in the original side of the Bombay High Court against the appellant for recovery of a sum of Rs. 92,884 4 10 on the basis of a judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of New York affirming two awards obtained by it and also on the awards in the alternative. 20 The respondent was a partnership firm carrying on import and export business in Bombay. By two letters exchanged between them, the appellant and the respondent agreed to do business in turmeric fingers on the terms and conditions of the American Spice Trade Association, one of which was an arbitration clause which ran as follows : \"All questions and controversies and all claims arising under this contract shall be submitted to and settled by Arbitration under the Rules of the American Spice Trade Asso ciation printed on the reverse side thereof. This contract is made as of in New York. \" The appellant failed to supply turmeric in terms of the two contracts it entered into with the respondent. The respondent put the matter into arbitration in pursuance of the arbitration clause. The appellant took no part in it. The arbitrators gave the two awards in favour of the respondent for damages. The appellant did not pay. The respondent then took appropriate proceedings and got the awards confirmed by the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. The single judge of the Bombay High Court who tried the suit held that it was not maintainable either on the foreign judgment or on the awards and (dismissed the suit. The Division Bench on appeal held that the suit was maintainable on the awards, though not on the judgment, as part of the cause of action had arisen in Bombay and the relevant facts had been proved by the Public documents produced by the respondent and the admissions made by the appellant and decreed the suit. Held, (per Dayal and Mudholkar JJ.) The decision of the Single judge of the High Court that the suit was not maintainable on the foreign judgment must be affirmed but on other grounds. Apart from the provisions of the Arbitration Protocol and Conventions Act, 1937, foreign awards and foreign judgments based upon award arc enforceable in India on the same grounds and in the same circumstances in which they are enforceable in England under the Common Law on grounds of justice, equity and good conscience. On the original side of the Bombay High Court English Common Law is also applicable under cl. 19 of the Letters Patent read with cl. XLI of the Charter of that Court. If the award is followed by a judgment which is rendered in a proceeding in which the person against whom judgment is sought can take objections as to the validity of the award, the judgement will be enforceable in England. Even then the plaintiff will have the right to sue on the original course of action. Secondly, even a foreign award will be enforced only if it satisfies mutate 's mutandis the tests applicable to the enforcement of foreign judgments on the ground that it creates a contractual obligation arising out of submission to arbitration. But there is a difference of opinion in this connection on two matters, (1) whether an award which 21. is followed by a judgment can be enforced as an award or whether the judgment alone can be enforced, and (2) whether an award which is not enforceable in the country in which it was made without an enforcement order or a judgement, can be enforced or in such a case the only remedy is to sue on the original cause of action. Thirdly, both a foreign judgment and a foreign award may be sued upon provided certain conditions are fulfilled one of which is that it has become final. Although, therefore, the respondent could sue on the original cause of action in the Bombay High Court that cause of action must be distinguished from the one furnished by the 'judgment of the New York Supreme Court which must be held to have arisen in New York and not in Bombay and was a cause of action independent of the one afforded by the contracts and the Bombay High Court would, consequently, have no jurisdiction to try the suit based on that judgment. East India Trading Co. vs Carmel Exporters & Importers Ltd., , Schibsby vs Westenholz., and Re Davidson 's Settlement Trust, (1873) L. R. 15 Eq. 383, referred to. In a suit based on a foreign award the plaintiff has to prove,. (1) that the contract between the parties provided for arbitration by a tribunal in a foreign country, (2) that the award is in accordance with the agreement, (3) that the award is valid according to the law of that country (4) that it was final according to that law and, (5) that it was subsisting award at the date of the suit. The essential difference between a foreign judgement and 2 foreign award is that while the former is a command of the foreign, sovereign and the coming of nations accords international recognition to it if it fulfill certain basic requirements, the latter is founded on the contract between the parties and is not given the status of a judgment in the country in which it is made 'and cannot claim the same international status as the act of a foreign sovereign. Even though an award may not have obtained the status of judgment in the country in which it is made, if it possesses the essential attribute of a judgment, that is finality, it can be sued upon in in other country. Union Nationaledes Cooperatives Agricoles de Careales vs Robert Catterall & Co. Ltd. ' , referred to. But the finality that r. 15, cl. (E) of the American Spice Trade Association gives to the awards in question is no more than a matter of contract between the parties and must be subject to the law of the State. A reference to the laws of the State of New York makes it abundantly clear that the relevant provisions of the laws of the 22 State under which alone the awards could become final had not been complied with and they could not, therefore, provide a cause of action for the suit. For an award to furnish a fresh cause of action, it must be final. If the law of the country in which it was made gives finality to the judgment based on an award and not to the award itself, the award cannot furnish a cause of action in India. Although the High Court of Bombay has jurisdiction to enforce a final award made in a foreign country in pursuance of a submission made within the limits of its original jurisdiction, the awards in question not being final the suit must fail. Per Subba Rao J. The doctrine of non merger of the original cause of action with the foreign judgment pronounced upon it is a well established doctrine. Popat vs Damodar, , Oppenbeim and Co. vs Mohmed Haneef, Mad. 496 and Nil Ratan Mukhopahya vs Cooch Behar Loan Office, Ltd. I.L.R. , referred to. If the contract does not merge in the judgment, by a parity of reasoning an award on which a foreign judgment is passed cannot also merge in the judgment. There is no distinction between a foreign award which would require an enforcement order to be enforceable in law and an award which cannot be enforced except by a judgment. An en forcement order as well as a judgment on an award serves the same purpose and they are two different procedures for enforcing, an award. Meerifield Ziegler & Co. vs Liverpool Cotton Association Ltd., , referred to. A suit would, therefore, lie on a foreign award completed according to the law of that country and before a decree can be passed on it three things must be proved, (1) arbitration agreement, (2) that the arbitration was conducted in accordance with the agreement, and (3) that the award was valid according to the law of the country when it was made. Norske Atlas Insurance Co. Ltd. vs London General Insurance Company Limited. , referred to. It was not correct to say that the High Court had gone wrong in holding that the three necessary conditions had been proved by the admission of the appellants in their pleadings. Rules 3, 4 and 5 of the Order VIII of the Code of Civil Procedure form an integrated code dealing with the manner in ,which the allegations of fact made in a plaint has to be traversed :and the legal consequences that follow from its non compliance. 23 The written statement must deal specifically with each allegation of fact made in the plaint and if the defendant denies any such fact, such denial must not be evasive, he must answer the point of substance and if he fails to do so the said fact must be take to be admitted. The discretion under the proviso to r. 5 has to be exercise by the court as justice demands and particularly according to the nature of the parties, standard of drafting prevailing in the locality and the practice of the court. There can be no doubt that pleadings on the original side of the Bombay High Court have to be strictly construed in the light of the said provisions unless the court thinks fit to exercise it discretion under the proviso. Tildesley vs Harper, and Laxmi narayan vs Chimniram Girdharilal, Bom. 89 referred to. The said three conditions were also proved by the exhibited record of the proceedings of the Supreme Court of New York containing the certificate of the Consul General of India in New York and certified copies of the order and judgment of the Supreme Court. While under section 78(6) of the Indian Evidence Act, proof of the character of the document according to the law of the foreign country, is condition precedent to its admission, such admission is not a condition precedent for drawing the requisite presumption under section 86 of the Act. That presumption can be drawn before the document is admitted. The judgment of the Supreme Court of New York, therefore, which satisfied the first two conditions laid down by section 78(6), could be legitimately admitted into evidence. The contracts between the parties having been concluded within the local limits of the original jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court, a part of the cause of action must have arisen there. and that court had jurisdiction to try the suit on the awards. \n",
            "Prediction: The respondents instituted a suit against the appellants in the High Court of judicature at Bombay, in its Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction, for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 92,884/4/10 with interest thereon. Following the procedure prescribed for the enforcement of such awards in New York, the respondents initiated proceedings in the Supreme Court of the State of New York to have the said awards confirmed and a judgment entered thereon in the said Court. The suit was tried in the first instance by Mody J. The learned judge, inter alia, held that the suit on the foreign judgment would not lie in the Bombay High Court, as there was no obligation under the terms and conditions of the said Trade Association Contract, all claims arising under the contract should be submitted to, and settled by, arbitration under the rules of the Association. Adverting to the claim based on the agreement resulting in the awards, the learned Judge observed that there were no admissions\n",

            "Target: In the appeals by Special Leave to this Court the question for consideration was: whether an arbitrator to whom a reference was made without the intervention of the Court could award interest during the period prior to the reference and during the pendency of the arbitration: ^ HELD: 1. The general statutory provisions in regard to the award of interest by the Court are contained in the Interest Act and the Civil Procedure Code. [258F] 2. The Interest Act of 1839 was repealed and a new Interest Act incorporated in 1978. Both these Acts provide for the award of interest upto the date of the institution of the proceedings. Neither the Interest Act of 1839 nor the Interest Act of 1978 provides for the award of pendente lite interest. [260D] 3. The award of pendente lite interest is provided for in Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code. Section 34 however, applies to arbitrations in suits for the simple reason that where a matter is referred to arbitration in a suit, the arbitrator will have all the powers of the Court in deciding the dispute. Section 34 does not otherwise apply to arbitrations as arbitrators are not courts within the meaning of section 34 Civil Procedure Code. [260E] 254 4. While under the Interest Act of 1978 the expression 'court ' was defined to exclude an arbitrator, under the Interest Act of 1839 it was not so defined. The result is that while in cases arising after the commencement of the Interest Act of 1978 an arbitrator has the same power to award interest upto the date of institution of proceedings, in cases which arose prior to commencement of the 1978 Act the arbitrator has no such power under the Interest Act of 1839. [260G] 5. Since the arbitrator is required to conduct himself and make the award in accordance with law, the substantive law has to be looked into for the power of the arbitrator to award interest before the commencement of the proceedings. [260H 261A] 6. If the agreement between the parties entitles the arbitrator to award interest no further question arises and the arbitrator may award interest. Similarly, if there is a usage of trade having the force of law the arbitrator must award interest. [261B] 7. Again, there are other provisions of the substantive law enabling the award of interest by the arbitrator. Section 80 of the Negotiable Instruments Act under which the court may award interest even in a case where no rate of interest is specified in the promissory note or bill of exchange, and Section 61(2) of the Sale of Goods Act which provides for the award of interest to the seller or the buyer under certain circumstances in suits filed by them. [261C] 8. There is also the instance of non performance of a contract of which equity could give specific performance and to award interest. [261C] 9. Where one of the parties is forced to pay interest to a third party say on an overdraft, consequent on the failure of the other party to the contract not fulfilling the obligation of paying the amount due to them, equity may compel the payment of interest. [261C] 10. Loss of interest in the place of the right to remain in possession may be rightfully claimed in equity by the owner of a property who has been dispossessed from it. [261D] 11. In the instant appeals, in those cases in which the references to arbitration were made prior to the commencement of the new Act which was on August 19, 1981 and the amount claimed was a certain sum payable at a certain time by virtue of a written instrument, interest is payable under the Interest Act for the period before the commencement of the proceeding. [269H 270A] 255 12. In regard to pendente lite interest, that is, interest from the date of reference to the date of the award, the claimants would not be entitled to the same for the simple reason that the arbitrator is not a court within the meaning of section 34 of the CPC, nor were the references to arbitration made in the course of suits.[1270C] 13. In the remaining cases which arose before the commencement of the , the respondents are not entitled to claim interest either before the commencement of the proceedings or during the pendency of the arbitration. They are not entitled to claim interest for the period prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings for the reason that the Interest Act, 1839 does not apply to their cases and there is no agreement to pay interest or any usage of trade having the force of law or any other provision of law under which the claimants were entitled to recover interest. They are not entitled to claim pendente lite interest as the arbitrator is not a court nor were the references to arbitration made in suits. [270D E] 14. The arbitrator is bound to make his award in accordance with law. If the arbitrator could not possibly have awarded interest on any permissible ground because such ground did not exist, it would be open to the court to set aside the award relating to the award of interest on the ground of an error apparition the record. On the other hand, if there was the slightest possibility of the entitlement of the claimant to interest on one or other of the legally permissible grounds, it may not be open to the court to go behind the award and decide whether the award of interest was justifiable.

            "Target: The appellant was born in India before the partition. He left for Pakistan and returned to India in 1953 on a Pakistani passport and Indian visa. He did not return to Pakistan before the expiry of the period for which he was permitted to stay in India under the visa. He was convicted for a breach of paragraph 7 Of the Foreigners Order, 1948, which required every \"foreigner\" entering India to depart from India before the expiry of the period during which he was authorised to remain in India. Held, that the appellant was not a foreigner on the date of his entry into India and his conviction was bad. On the relevant date the appellant was a natural born British subject within section 1(1)(a) of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, and consequently was not a foreigner as defined in section 2(a) of the , as it then stood. \n",

This contention of the appellant is plainly correct. The word \"foreigner\" in paragraph 7 is defined in that Act in section 2(a).

The Commercial Tax Officer rejected the application on the ground that the disposal of unclaimed goods for valuable consideration was a regular feature of the assessee 's activ ities, and, therefore, the assessee fell within the scope of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941. Assessee 's revision application was rejected by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes on the ground that the sales effected by the assessee were sales under the Act and that the assessee was a \"dealer\". A second revision of the assessee was also dismissed by the Additional Commis sioner of Sales Tax. On a further revision the Board of Revenue also con firmed the status of the assessee as a \"dealer\", holding that in the systematic and organised character of business of auctioning by the assessee, a transfer of property was involved and therefore a sale of goods took place. At the instance of the assessee a reference was made to the High Court. The High Court answered the question in favour of the assessee by holding that the disposal of the goods did not indicate that the 778 Railway was carrying on business as a dealer liable to assessment under the Act. The assessee in the connected appeal, Eastern Railway, was engaged in selling scrap and unserviceable material, and a similar order was passed by the High Court in its favour. Hence these appeals by the Revenue. Allowing the appeals and setting aside the judgments of the High Court, this Court, HELD: 1. The assessee South Eastern Railway was a carri er of the goods and if at the stage of delivery, goods remained unclaimed for a period, the Railway was entitled to dispose them of. The activity of so disposing of the goods was adjunctive to the principal activity of the carriage of goods by the Railway. It is an activity which may be regard ed as necessarily incidental or ancillary to its business as carrier of the goods. Therefore, the assessee South Eastern Railway was a \"dealer\" for the purposes of the Bengal Fi nance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941. [780G H] 2. The assessee in the connected appeal, Eastern Rail way, who was disposing scrap and unserviceable material was also a \"dealer\" for the purposes of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941.

            "Target: The disputes between the appellant, the management of the D.C.M. Chemical Works which was a constituent unit of the Delhi Cloth and General Mills Limited (the Company), and its workmen related, inter alia, to wage scales and gratuity. The workmen claimed that the chemical works was an integral part of the Company and, therefore, the over all position of the Company should be taken into account in fixing the wage structure. The Industrial Tribunal to which the matter was referred held that in the circumstances of the case the chemical works should be treated as an independent unit and that the wage structure etc. could not be fixed on the basis of the over. all position of the Company. The facts showed that the high the Company was a single limited concern owning and controlling various industrial units of different kinds under it. There were certain features which went to show that the various undertakings carried on by the Company had been treated as independent concerns and could not lead to the conclusion that they were one integrated whole. It was found that (i) each unit had separate books of account and separate profit and loss account, (ii) each unit had separate muster rolls for its employees, and transfers from one unit to the other usually took place with the consent of the employees concerned, (iii) each unit had its own separate wages and dearness allowance and bonus was also paid differently in each concern,(iv) where sales took place from one unit to another they were at market price and not at cost price, and (v) each unit had its own separate management. The evidence showed that throughout the course of its existence since 1942 the chemical works had made profits only in two years and that for the rest of the time it had been making losses which had to be met by the Com pany out of the profits of other units. Held, that on the facts found in the present case, there was no nexus of integration between different lines of business carried on by the Company and that the Tribunal was right in 517 its conclusion that the chemical works was ' an independent unit and that, therefore, in fixing the wage structure etc. , one had to look to the position of the chemical works only and could not integrate it with other units.

Ltd. vs Industrial Court, Bombay, (1962) (3) S.C.R. (Supp.) p. 196, applied. Held, further, that in making a direction for the fixation of an increased fair wage on an incremental scale, the present financial condition of the concern and its stability are both necessary to be considered. There is a difference between a minimum wage and fair wage which is above the bare minimum wage. In the former case the tribunal could insist that the employer paid minimum wages even out of capital. Messrs Crown Aluminium Works vs Their Workmen, (1958) S.C.R. 651, referred to. Held, also, that it is well settled that both gratuity As well as provident fund schemes can be framed in the same concern if its financial position allows it, and that though the financial position of the chemical works had not been found to be good and stable enough to warrant an incremental wage structure, the direction given by the Tribunal for the framing of a gratuity scheme was not erroneous, as it was a long term provision and there was no reason to suppose that in the long run the appellant would not be in a flourishing condition. \n",

It had two classes of members, club members, whose number was limited to 350 and stand members who were elected by ballot. Every member Paid an entries fee and an annual subscription. The liability of the members was limited by guarantee and if there was any surplus on winding up, it was to be paid to the members in equal shares. An admission fee was levied from the members for admission to the Members ' Enclosure, and from non members for admission to the other Enclosures, and in each Enclosure there was a totalisator. The money 's received from members as well as non members were included in one pool and distributed amongst the holders of the winning tickets. In each Enclosure refreshments were supplied on payment. The company admitted that moneys realised from non members were receipts from business and taxable, but contended that the following items of receipts received from members were not assessable to income tax, viz., (1) season 0admission tickets from members, (2) daily admission gate tickets from members, (3) use of private boxes by members (4) income from entries and forfeits received from members whose horses did not run. The High Court of Bombay held that items 1, 2 and 3 did not fall either under section 10(1) or section 10(6) of the Income tax Act and were therefore not taxable, but item 4 fell within section 10(1) and section 10(6) and was taxable. The Commissioner of Income tax appealed; Held, (i) that the principles of Styles ' case as explained by subsequent cases had no application to the company as there was no mutual dealing between the members inter se in the nature of mutual insurance and no contribution to a common fund put up for payment of liabilities undertaken by each contributor to the other contributors, and no refund of surplus to the contributors, but on the other hand, the company realised moneys both from the members and non members for the same consideration, namely, by the giving of the same or similar facilities to all alike in the course of one and the same business carried on by it; (ii)that, as the company was formed for carrying on a business it had dealings with its members also in the ordinary course of business, and give the same or similar amenities to members and non members, and there were no mutual dealings between the members or a common fund for the discharge of common obligations to each other, the principle applicable to the surplus of contributions made by members of a club for Providing themselves with amenities was also not applicable to the case; (iii) a \"trade association\" means an association of tradesmen businessmen or manufacturers for their common protection and advancement, and the assessee was not therefore \"a trade or similar association\" within section 10(6) of the Income tax Act; 291 (iv) that all the abovementioned 4 item of receipts from members were received by the company from business carried on by it with its members within the meaning of section 10(1) and none of them was received by the company as a trade, profes sional or similar association within the meaning of section 10(6), and ail the items were accordingly assessable to income tax.

            "Target: An agreement was entered into by Dharangadhara Chemical Works Ltd. (Chemical Company) for the sale of all its products to the respondent (Trading Company). The agreement contained general terms; and the actual quantity sold, the sale price, the booking station and the destination stations were to be determined in the actual contracts for sale in respect of definite or specified quantities. The mode in which sales were effected was that the respondent Trading Company used to obtain orders from out of State buyers, and enter into agreements of purchase with the Chemical Company for these specified quantities. All the goods sold under these contracts of sale were booked at a particular railway station in the State to the various places outside the State, where buyers from the respondent Trading Company required the goods and then the railway receipts and invoices concerned were endorsed and handed over to the respondent Trading Company. In the assessment order for the assessment year 1980 81 the assessing authority treated the sales effected by the Chemical Company to the respondent Trading Company as intra State sales and those by the respondent Trading Company to the out of State buyers as inter State sales falling under section 3 of the . The assessees, namely, the Chemical Company and the respondent Trading Company filed appeals before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner contending that sales by the Chemical Company to the respondent Trading Company were also inter State sales as these sales were completed by the delivery of railway receipts and invoices only after the inter State journey of the goods had commenced. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner dismissed the appeals. Both the assessees filed appeals to the Tribunal. After considering 806 the manner in which the sales were effected and despatches made by the Chemical Company and examining some specimen orders placed by respondent Trading Company with the Chemical Company, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that delivery was effected by the Chemical Company to the respondent Trading Company by delivery of documents of title, namely, the receipts of invoices and the railway receipts and allowed the appeals. The High Court upheld the views of the Tribunal and dismissed the revision petitions filed by the State. In the appeals by the State it was contended that the first set of sales by the Chemical Company to the respondent Company were local or intra State sales, because under the agreement the delivery was to be effected at the booking stations. Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: The orders were placed for booking specified goods to out of State buyers and the Chemical Company never gave physical delivery of the goods to the respondent Trading Company but booked the goods to the destinations as required by the out of State buyers and merely handed over documents of title to the respondent Trading Company. The movement of the goods from the State to the outside State was occasioned by the terms of the contract themselves and the sales were inter State sales falling under sub section (a) of section 3 of the . Alternatively, since the deliveries of goods sold were effected by the transfer of documents after the movement of the goods from the State to the other States had commenced, the sales could be regarded as covered under sub section (b) of section 3 of the Act. [809GH; 810A B] The agreement entered into by the Chemical Company with the respondent Trading Company is merely a general agreement. The actual terms of the contracts of sales as well as the instructions of the out of State buyers have to be taken into account in determining the nature of the sales in question. [810E F] The conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal as well as the High Court that the sales by the Chemical Company to the respondent Trading Company were inter State sales cannot therefore be faulted.

            "Target: On inspection three of the workmen were found working in a factory before their shift commenced. It was stated that the Inspector of Factories was informed by a letter written a day prior to this inspection about the change of the timing though the letter did not reach the Inspector till the day after the inspection. This change in the hours of work was not notified and displayed as required by section 61(1) of the . The respondent as the occupied/manager of the factory was convicted under section 63 of the Act. On appeal, the Sessions Judge acquitted the respondent holding that the second part of section 61(10) of the Act applied to a case of second or subsequent change in the system of work in a factory and this being the first change there was no need to wait for a week or to obtain the previous sanction of the Inspector as required by the later part of section 61(101), and further section 117 of the Act protected the action because it was bonafide. The State appealed to the High Court which agreed with the Sessions Judge in his interpretation of section 61(10) but expressed no opinion on section 117 of the Act and it dismissed the appeal. On appeal by special leave: Held: (i) The respondent was not saved from the opera tion of section 63 which is peremptory, by reason of anything contained in section 61(10) and the sending of the letter to the Inspector of Factories was therefore misconceived. The words \"change in the system of work in any factory which will necessitate a change in the notice\" in section 61(10) refer not to departure from the notice but to a change in the system, a change which would require the notice to be recast. The notice shows \"the period during which adult workers may be required to work\" and these words are descriptive of the scheme of employment of labour in the factory but are not apt to contemplate the time of employment for each individual worker. That can only be found by referring to the register which goes with the notice. Sub section (1) makes no mention of the change in the register but of the change in the notice and thereby indicates that the change which is contemplated is an over all change affective to a whole group and not an individual worker. The latter part of the sub section also points in the same direction because it implies that such changes should not be frequent and if the change is for the second time it should not be made until one week has. elapsed since the last change. (ii) The language of section 117 of the Act is not limited to officers but is made wide to include \"any person\". The protection conferred can only be claimed by a person who can plead that he was required to do or omit to do something under the Act or that he intended to comply with any of its provisions. It cannot confer immunity in respect of actions which are not done under the Act but are done contrary to it. 657 (iii) The occupier and manager, are exempted from liabi lity in certain cases mentioned in section 101. Where an occupier or a manager is charged with an offence he is entitled to make a complaint in his own turn against any person who was the actual offender and on such proof the occupier or the manager is a solved from liability. This shows that compliance with the peremptory provisions of the Act is essential and unless the occupier or the manager brings the real offender to book he must bear the responsibility. It is not necessary that means rea must always be established. The responsibility exists without a guilty mind. Ranjit Singh vs Emperor, A.I.R. (1943) Oudh 308, Ranjit Singh vs Emperor, A.I.R.

            "Target: Tsubongse the election petitioner and the respondent herein who contested from the Longkhim Chre constituency of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly as a Congress (I) candidate in the election held on 10.11.82 lost by a margin of 133 votes to Horangse the appellant and who was the Deputy Speaker of the last legislative Assembly. The respondent filed an election petition on the ground that the appellant was guilty of four instances of corrupt practice falling under Section 123(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 and on three other grounds, namely; (1) display of a banner with the caption \"do not sell Nagaland to India\", a corrupt practice within the meaning of Section 123 (3A) of the Act; (2) exceeding the limit of expenditure amounting to corrupt practice within the meaning of Section 123(6) of the Act and (3) use of government vehicles for the purpose of the election. The learned Single Judge, who tried the election petition, found only one of the aforesaid grounds of corrupt practice, namely, presentation of four red waist coats proved and the other grounds not proved, and therefore, he allowed the election petition and set aside the appellant 's election on that ground. Hence the appeal. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD :In an election petition, the petitioner who alleges corrupt practice must prove his case which is disputed by the returned candidate indepen 343 dently of the fact whether the returned candidate has proved his defence or not. [348E] Here on the evidence of R.Ws. 1 to 5, the appellant got the waist coats distributed through P.W. 14 who was then a staunch worker of the Naga National Democratic Party in September, 1982 long before the election process had started, as per the custom of Nagas to make gifts in return for the gifts received by dignitaries. The evidence let in by the respondent election petitioner to prove the item of alleged corrupt practice on the part of the appellant is wholly insufficient and unacceptable to prove the charge satisfactorily. Though in the election petition it is clearly alleged that the appellant gave red waist coats to P.Ws. 11 to 13 and Lithsabha at 4 p.m. On 27.10.82 for inducing them to cast their votes in his favour in the presence of P.Ws. 14 and 15 and they witnessed the offer and reported the matter subsequently to the respondent, P. Ws. 14 and 15 do not claim in their evidence personal knowledge about the offer on presentation of the waist coats by the appellant to these four persons and about the inducement of the appellant to cast their votes in favour. Admittedly, P.W. 14 had asked P.Ws. 11, 12 and 13 to remember the date and time of the appellant 's visit to their houses where he claims to have gone alongwith P.W. 15 soon after the departure of the appellant from each of those places. It is clear that these three witnesses, P.Ws. 11 to 13 have mentioned the date and month of the appellant 's visit only on the basis of what P.W. 14 told them to remember. P. W. 14 who was a staunch worker of the NNDP and had switched over to the Congress (I) Party to which P.W. 15 belongs, sometime before the election, and P.W. 16 are interested witnesses. P.W. 15 has stated in his evidence that the appellant appealed to the people of the village to cast their votes in his favour and that he went to the houses of P.Ws. 11 to 13 in Lirise village only thereafter. If that is so, it is not likely that the appellant, then the Deputy Speaker would have carried the gunny or hessian bag containing the waist coats himself without being accompanied even by a single worker or sympathiser of the NNDP when he is stated to have visited those four houses for presenting the waist coats and inducing the recipients to cast their votes in his favour. The evidence of P.Ws. 11 to 13 that P.Ws. 14 and 15 came to their houses within minutes after the appellant left the places and asked them about what had been given to them by the appellant and that when they told them that red waist coats have been given to then with a request to favour him with their votes, and they asked them to remember the date and time and not to deny the matter later P.W. 14 has stated so in his evidence is artificial and unreliable. The evidence of P.Ws. 11 to 15 about the date of the appellant 's visit to Lirise village and the presentation of the red waist coats to P.Ws. 11 to 13 and another is equally not impressive. Therefore, the appellant cannot be said to have committed any \"corrupt practice\". [351B C; 350C H] \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant, who contested as a Congress (I) candidate, lost to the appellant by a margin of 133 votes in the election held on 10 11 1982 on the ground of corrupt practice falling under section 123(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 (for short 'the Act ') and on three other grounds, namely: (1) display of a banner with the caption \"Do not sell Nagaland to India\", a corrupt practice within the meaning of section 123A of the Act and (2) use of government vehicles for the purpose of the election. The appellant denied that the waist coats were given either by himself or in order to induce the recipients to cast their votes in his favour.

By virtue of this power the President enacted the Pepsu Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1953, the object of which was to provide a penalty, inter alia, for spreading disaffection among the police. The appellants were charged with having induced or attempted to induce members of the police force to withhold their, services and thus to commit a breach of discipline by staying away without doing their duty, and thereby having committed an offence under section 3 of the Act. They were convicted by the Magistrate and the conviction was confirmed by the High Court. The appellants challenged the validity of the conviction on the ground that section 3 was violative of the freedom guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and was not saved by article 19(2). Held, that section 3 of the Pepsu Police (Incitement to dis affection) Act, 1953, did not infringe article ' (19)(1)(a) of the Constitution and was intra vires. The Police service is an arm of the State charged with the duty of ensuring and maintaining public order and since any breach of discipline on the part of its members might 26 result in a threat to public order, section 3 must be held to be valid as having been enacted \"in the interests of public order\" within the meaning of article 19(2).

            "Target: These appeals raised the question of constitutional validity of the Vindhya Pradesh Abolition of jagirs and Land Reforms Act, I952 (XI Of 1952). Applications were made before the judicial Commissioner under article 226 of the Constitution on the ground that various provisions of the Act placed unreasonable restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The judicial Commissioner held that the Act, excepting section 22(1), section 37 and cl. (4)(e) of the Schedule to the Act, was constitutionally valid. The State appealed against that part of the order which declared the three provisions unconstitutional and one of the petitioners appealed against the order declaring the rest of the Act constitutional. Held, that the appeal of the State must be allowed and that of the petitioner dismissed. It was not correct to say that section 22 of the Act, which lays down the scheme for giving, effect to section 7(a) of the Act which permits the jagirdars to remain in possession of certain lands even after the abolition of their jagirs, is a piece of colourable legislation and, therefore, ultra vires the Legislature. That section cannot be said to discriminate as between jagirdars on the one hand and other occupants of land, to whom section 28(1) applies, on the other, since they belong to distinct and different classes. 107 Even assuming that they belong to the same class and section 22 is discriminatory, that section is protected by article 31A of the Constitution. The question as to colourable legislation ' is really one relating to legislative competency and there can be no doubt that the Vindhya Pradesh Legislature was perfectly competent to enact the impugned provisions under Entry 18, List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. K. C. Gajapati Narayan Deo vs The State of Orissa. [1954] S.C.R. i and Raghubir Singh vs The State of Ajmer (Now Rajasthan). [1959] SuPP1. (1) S.C.R. 478, relied on. There was no substance in the contention that section 37 of the Act is repugnant to section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure and consequently ultra vires the State Legislature. The Vindaya Pradesh Legislature had undoubtedly the power under Entry 3, List II of the Seventh Schedule to make a provision like section 37 Of the Act and, once it did so, the last part of section 9 of the Code would apply and the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts would be barred by section 9 of the Code read with section 37 of the Act. Nor was it correct to say that cl. (4)(e) of the Schedule deprives the jagirdar of his proprietory interest without compensation. Although he may have to pay rent for the land remaining with him, no revenue for such land was any longer payable by him and the revenue is taken into account in assessing compensation. The entire Act, therefore, falls within the protection of article 31A of the Constitution and, in view of the decisions of this Court, its constitutional validity is beyond question.

The Judicial Commissioner held that the Act was constitutional, except for three provisions thereof, namely, section 22(1), section 37 and cl. (4) (e) of the Schedule to the Act, relating to similar legislation in the State of Ajmer (now Rajasthan) (8) and Atma Ram vs The State of Punjab (9).

In September, 1963, purporting to act under regulation 5 of the Regulations, the Selection Committee recommended his supersession, along with some others, on the ground that the Committee considered that the records of \"the officers were not such as to justify their appointment to the Indian Police Service at this stage\". He was reverted in September. Before the High Court the appellant contended that the Selection Committee 's failure to specify the reasons for his supersession, in contravention of the Regulations, rendered the list non est.

Civil Appeal No. 931 of 1977 arose out of the suit for possession by the Gram Panchayat against the descendants of the grantee of inam. The suit was dismissed by the Trial Court and was confirmed by the High Court and the High Court granted leave under Art.133. Civil Appeal No. 200 of 1978 arose out of the suit for possession and mesne profits which was laid by the descendants of the grantee of inam. The pleadings are the same in both cases. A Zamindar granted 100 acres of land inam to dig, preserve 532 and maintain a tank in favour of the predecessors of the respondents of C.A. No. 931/77. In 1700 A.D.i.e. , 1190 Fasli, the tank was dug by the villagers and ever since, the villagers were using the tank for their drinking purpose and perfected their right by prescription. In course of time the tank was silted up and fresh water existed only in and around 30 acres. The grantee 's descendants respondents did not make any repairs, Grass and trees had been grown in the rest of the area and was being enjoyed. Under section 3 of the A.P.Inams ( Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, ( Act XXXVII of 1956) Ryotwari Patta was granted to the respondents in individuals capacity and on appeal the Revenue Divisional Officer confirmed the same and it became final, as it was not challenged any further. On 7.7.1965, the Gram panchayat the appellant in C.A. No. 931/77 took unilateral possession of the tank and ever since , it was exercising possession, supervision and control over it. After the expiry of three year from the date of dispossession, the respoondents filed a suit for possession based on title. Earlier thereto the appellant Gram Panchayat had filed a suit for possession. The Trial Court found that the tank was a 'public trust ', the appellants would be hereditary trustees and could be removed only by taking action under section 77 of the A.P. Hindu Charitable and Religious Institutions and Endowments Act, 1966 and that the respondents had acquired title by adverse possession. Accordingly the suit for possession was decreed relegating the filing of separate application for mesne profit. On appeal, the High Court reversed the decree and held that the tank was a public tank, and the tank and the lands stood vested in the Gram Panchyat under A.P. Gram Panchayat Act,1964. Since, the Gram Panchayat was in possession from July 7, 1966, though dispossessed the respondents forcibly and as the suit was not under section 6 of the , but one based on title, it called for interference and dismissed the suit. This court granted leave to appeal under article 136. 533 The respondents in C.A. No. 931/77 (the appellants in C.A. No. 200/78) contended that in view of the entries of the Inam Fair Register, the tank was a public trust and not a public tank; they could not be dispossessed until recourse made under section 77 of the A.P. Charitable and Religious Institutions and Endowments Act; that under the Gram Panchayat Act, the lands did not vest in the gram Panchayat; and that since the grant of ryotwari patta under the Inams Act had become final, section 14, thereof barred the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to entertain the suit. The appellant Gram Panchayat in C.A. No. 931/77 (the respondents in C.A. No. 200/78) contended that the tank and the appurtenant land was correctly held as public tank by the High Court that by operation of sections 85 and 64 of the Gram Panchayat Act, the land and the tank stood vested in the Panchayat, that the entries in the Inam Fair Register established that the grant of land was for preservation, maintenance and repairs of the tank and therefore, the grant should be in favour of the institution, i. e., the tank and the respondents thereby did not acquire any title, that ryotwari patta was only for the purpose of land revenue; that the Gram Panchayat acquired absolute right, title and interest in the land; and the suit was not a bar in the facts of the case. Dismissing both appeals, this Court HELD: 1.01. Any property or income, which belongs to or has been administered for the benefit of the villagers in common or the holders in any of the village land generally or of land of a particular description or of lands under particular source of irrigation shall vest in Gram Panchayat and be administered by it for the benefit of the villagers or holders. The lands or income used for communal purpose shall either belong to the Gram Panchayat or has been administered by the Gram Panchayat. It is not the case of the Gram Panchayat nor any finding recorded by the courts below to that effect. section 64 is not attracted though the villagers acquired prescriptive right to use the water from the tank for their use and of their cattle. [554D F] 1.02. All public water courses, springs, reservoirs, tanks, cisterns, etc. and other water works either existing on the date of the Act or made thereafter by the Gram Panchayat, or otherwise including those used by the public ripened into prescriptive right for the use and benefit of the public and also adjacent or any appurtenant land not being private property shall vest in the Gram Panchayat under section 85(1) and be subject to its control. [554F G] 534 2.01. The word`vesting ' in section 85 would signify that the water courses and tanks, lands etc. used by the public to such an extent as to give a prescripvtive right to their use, are vested in the Gram Panchayat, and placed them under the control and supervision of the Gram Panchayat. It confers no absolute or full title. It was open to the Government, even after vesting, to place restriction upon the Gram Panchayat in the matter of enjoyment and use of such tanks, and appurtenant lands etc. The assumption of management by the Government would be subject to the prescriptive right of the villagers, if any. The vesting of the tanks etc. in the Gram Panchayat was with absolute rights and the village community rights would over ride against rights of the Government. [546C F] 2.02. The tank is a public tank and not a public trust and that under section 85(1) and section 64, the vesting of the tanks, the appurtenant land and the common land is only for the purpose of possession, supervision, control and use thereof for the villagers for common use subject to the over riding title by the Government and its assumption of management should be in terms of sub section (3) of section 85 of the Act and subject to the prescriptive right in the water, water spread tank for common use.

Land Encroachment Act, 1905; Talengana Area Land Revenue Act, relevant Abolition Acts like A.P. Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948, Inams Abolition Act etc. give absolute rights or vesting in the State over the forest land, tanks, rivers, mines, poramboke, land, etc. free from all encumbrances and the preexisting rights in the other land stood abolished and will be subject to the grant of Ryotwari Patta etc. [546F H] 3.02 Grant of Ryotwari patta is not a title but a right coupled with possession to remain in occupation and enjoyment, subject to payment of the land revenue to the State. [546H] 3.03. The entries in the Inam Fair Register are great acts of the State and coupled with the entries in the survey and settlement record 535 furnishes unimpeachable evidence. On construction of these documents, it would clearly emerge that the original grant was made for the preservation and maintenance of the tank and tax free Inam land was granted for that purpose, though it was in the name of the individual grantee. The grant was for the preservation and maintenance of the tank. [548C D] 3.04. The grant was for the institution. Under section 3 of the Inams Act, the enquiry should be, whether (1) a particular land is Inam land; (2) Inam land in a Ryotwari, Zamindar or Inam Village; and (3) is held by any institution. In view of the finding that the grant was for the preservation and maintenance of tank, the Inam land in an inam village was held by the institution, namely, the tank. Ryotwari patta shall, therefore, be in favour of the institution. Undoubtedly the ryotwari patta was granted in favour of the descendants. [548D F] 3.05. The pattas were obtained in the individuals name, the trustees of an institution cannot derive personal advantage from the administration of the trust property. The grant of patta was for the maintenance of the trust. [548G] 3.06. The descendants, though enjoyed the income from the properties, did not effect the repairs and neglected the maintenance and upkeep of the tank. They rendered the tank disused and abandoned. By operation of section 85 of the Act the lands and tank stood vested in the Gram Panchayat for control, management and supervision. [550E F] 3.07. A hereditary trustee is entitled to be the Chairman of a Board of Trustees, if any, constituted under the Endowment Act or else be in exclusive possession and management of the public trust registered thereunder until he is removed as per the procedure provided therein. Since the tank always remained a public tank and not being a public trust, the Endowment Act does not apply. Therefore, the question of initiating action under section 77 of the Endowment Act for removal of the descendants as trustees does not arise.

In the laws made to restructure the social order creating rights in favour of the citizens and conferring power and jurisdiction on the hierarchy of Tribunals or the authorities constituted thereunder and giving finality to their orders or decisions and divested the jurisdiction of the established civil courts expressly or by necessary implication Departure in the allocation of the judicial functions would not be viewed with disfavor for creating the new forums and entrusting the duties under the statutes to implement socio economic and fiscal laws. Courts have to consider, when questioned, why the legislature made the departure. The reason is obvious. The tradition bound civil courts gripped with rules of pleading and strict rules of evidence and tardy trial, four tier appeals, endless revisions and reviews under C.P.C. are not suited to the needed expeditious dispensation. The adjudicatory system provided in the new forums is cheap and rapid,. The procedure before the Tribunal is simple and not hide bound by the intricate procedure of pleadings, trial, admissibility of the evidence and proof of facts according to law. Therefore, there is abundant flexibility in the discharge of the functions with greater expedition and inexpensiveness. {552D H] 4.02. In order to find out the purpose in creating the Tribunals under the statues and the meaning of particular provisions in social legislation, the Court would adopt the purposive approach to ascertain the socials ends envisaged in the Act, to consider scheme of the Act as an integrated whole and practical means by which it was sought to be effectuated to achieve them. Meticulous lexographic analysis of words and phrases and sentences should be subordinate to this purposive approach. The dynamics of the interpretative functioning of the Court is to reflect the contemporary needs and the prevailing values consistent with the constitutional and legislative declaration of the policy envisa 537 ged in the statute under consideration. [552H 553B] 4.03. The law should, therefore, respond to the clarion call of social imperatives evolve in that process functional approach as means to subserve ``social promises ' ' set out in the Preamble, Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights of the Constitution. [553d] 4.04. Section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 provides that whenever a question arises before the Civil Court whether its jurisdiction is excluded expressly or by necessary implication, the court naturally feels inclined to consider whether remedy afforded by an alternative provision prescribed by special statute is sufficient or adequate. In cases where exclusion of the civil court 's jurisdiction is expressly provided for, the consideration as to the scheme of the statue in question and the adequacy of sufficiency of the remedy provided for by it may be relevant, but cannot be decisive. Where exclusion is pleaded as a matter of necessary implication such consideration would be very important and inconceivable circumstances might become even decisive. [553G 554B] 4.05. The jurisdiction of a Tribunal created under statute may depend upon the fulfilment of some condition precedent or upon existence of some particular fact. Such a fact is collateral to the actual matter which the Tribunal has to try and the determination whether it existed or not is logically temporary prior to the determination of the actual question which the Tribunal has to consider. At the inception of an enquiry by a Tribunal of limited jurisdiction, when a challenge is made to its jurisdiction, the Tribunal has to consider as the collateral fact whether it would act or not and for that purpose to arrive at some decision as to whether it has jurisdiction or not. There may be Tribunal which by virtue of the law constituting it has the power to determine finally, even the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of its jurisdiction depends; but subject to that, the Tribunal cannot by a wrong decision with regard to collateral fact, give itself a jurisdiction which it would not otherwise have except such tribunals of limited jurisdiction when the statue not only empowers to enquire into jurisdictional facts but also the rights and controversy finally it is entitled to enter on the enquiry and reach a decision rightly or wrongly. If it has jurisdiction to do right, it has jurisdiction to do wrong. It may be irregular or illegal which could be corrected in appeal or revision subject to that the order would become final. [554B F] 4.06. The Inams Act did not intend to leave the decisions of the revenue courts under section 3 read with section 7 to retry the issue once over in the civil court. [561D E] 538 4.07. The glimpse of the object of the Inams Act, scheme, scope and operation thereof clearly manifest that Inams Act is a self contained code, expressly provided rights and liabilities; prescribed procedure; remedies; of appeal and revision, excluded the jurisdiction of the civil court, notwithstanding anything contained in any law, given primacy of Inams Act though inconsistent with any law or instrument having force of law. The jurisdictional findings are an integral scheme to grant or refuse ryotwari pattta under section 3, read with section 7 and not collateral findings. It was subject to appeal and revision and certiorari under Art 226. The decision of the Revenue Tribunal, are final and conclusive between the parties or persons claiming right, title or interest through them. The trick of pleadings and the camouflage of the reliefs are not decisive but the substance or the effect on the order of the tribunal under the Inams Act are decisive. The civil suit except on grounds of fraud, misrepresentation or collusion of the parties is not maintainable. The necessary conclusion would be that the civil suit is not maintainable when the decree directly nullifies the ryotwari patta granted under section 3 of the Inams Act.

Under the Gram Panchayat Act the statutory interposition of vesting the tank and the appurtenant land in the Gram Panchayat made it to retain possession, control and supervision over it, though the Gram Panchayat unlawfully took possession. The need to grant decree for possession in favour of the Gram Panchayat is thus redundant. The suit 540 of the descendants normally to be decreed on the finding that ryotwari patta under section 3 of the Inams Act was granted in their favour and that they were unlawfully dispossessed. Since the grant of ryotwari patta, though in the name of individuals, was to maintain the public tank whcih stood vested under section 85 of the Act in the Gram panchayat, the descendants are divested of the right and interest acquired therein. Thus the suit of the descendants also is liable to be dismissed. [562A C] \n",

            "Target: The assessee firm purchased a Brengun factory from the Government of India and sold the stores and part of the lands and buildings shortly afterwards At a higher price. It admitted before the Income tax authorities that the purchase and sale in respect of the stores constituted an adventure in the nature of trade, but in respect of the land and buildings sold it contended that they had been purchased by way of investment, and the sale of a part of them did not result in assessable profit. The claim was rejected by the Income tax Officer, by the Appellate Commissioner, and by the Appellate Tribunal. The High Court in a reference under a. 66(1) also rejected it. The firm appealed to this Court by special leave. HELD : (i) In reaching the conclusion that a transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade, the Appellate Tribunal has to find the primary evidentiary facts and then apply the legal principle involved in the statutory expression \"adventure in the nature of trade,, used in section 2(4) of the Indian Income tax Act. A question of this description is a mixed question of law and fact and the decision of the Appellate Tribunal thereon is open to challenge under section 66(1) of the Act. [442 F G] (ii) The question whether the transaction is an adventure in the nature of trade must be decided on a consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances which are proved in the particular case. The answer to the question does not depend on the application of any abstract rule, principle or formula but must depend upon the total impression and effect of all the relevant facts and circumstances established in the particular case. [442 H] (iii) In the present case the appellant firm purchased the Brengun factory from borrowed money. The income from the property was only about 1/6 of the interest payable by the company on the money borrowed. The first sale was effected by the firm within three months of the purchase. and the sums received from sale were utilised for paying off the debts as also the dues to the Government. The firm had not enough financial resources to invest the money required to purchase the factory and the transaction could not therefore be with a view to making a permanent investment, but only for making profit. It had not been established by evidence that the appellant firm purchased the Brengun factory for purpose of establishing a cycle factory. Having regard to the total effect of all the relevant facts and circumstances established in the case it was rightly held by the High Court that the transaction was an adventure in the nature of trade and part of a profit making scheme.

            "Target: The issue in this appeal is whether the High Court of England and Wales has jurisdiction to order the return to this country of a small child who has never been present here on the basis that he is habitually resident here or that he has British nationality. The child, called Haroon in the judgment, was born on 20 October 2010 in Pakistan. His father was born in England and his mother in Pakistan. They married in Pakistan in 1999 and lived in England from 2000. They have four children: two daughters, born in 2001 and 2002, and two sons, one born in 2005 and Haroon. The father and the first three children, who were born in England, have dual British and Pakistani nationality and the mother has indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. From 2006 the father began to spend a lot of time in Pakistan. The marriage was unhappy and in 2008 the mother moved into a refuge with her three children complaining of abuse. The mother arranged a three week trip to Pakistan in October 2009, in order to visit her father with the children. When she was there she was put under pressure by her father, her husband and his family to reconcile with her husband and was forced to give up the childrens passports. She strongly wished to return to England and telephoned the refuge asking for their help to return from February 2010, when she became pregnant with Haroon. Eventually in May 2011 her family helped her to return to England without the children and she began proceedings for their return in the High Court. On 20 June 2011 all four children were made wards of court and the father was ordered to return them forthwith. The father challenged the jurisdiction of the court to make orders for the return of the children. The judge found that all four children were habitually resident in England and Wales as the mother had not agreed that the children should live in Pakistan. The older children had retained their habitual residence in England. Haroon had habitual residence because he was born to a mother who was being kept in Pakistan against her will. The Court of Appeal by a majority allowed the fathers appeal in relation to Haroon only, on the ground that habitual residence was a question of fact (rather than deriving from the habitual residence of the parents) and required physical presence in the country. The Supreme Court unanimously allows the mothers appeal and holds that the court had inherent jurisdiction to make the orders in this case on the basis of Haroons British nationality. The case is however remitted to the judge to consider as a matter of urgency whether it is appropriate to exercise this exceptional jurisdiction. Lady Hale gives the main judgment, with which Lord Wilson, Lord Reed, and Lord Toulson agree. Lord Hughes gives an additional judgment explaining why he would have held that Haroon was habitually resident in the circumstances of this case. The orders exercising the courts wardship jurisdiction in this case did not fall within Part 1 of the Family Law Act 1986 (the 1986 Act) [26 28]. They did relate to parental responsibility within the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (the Brussels II revised Regulation)(the Regulation) [29], which applied regardless of whether there was alternative jurisdiction in a non member state [33]. The question was whether there was jurisdiction under article 8 of the Regulation, which depended on where the child was habitually resident [34]. Habitual residence is a question of fact and not a legal concept such as domicile. It is desirable that the test for habitual residence be the same for the purposes of the 1986 Act, the Hague Child Abduction Convention and the Regulation, namely that adopted by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)for the purposes of the Regulation [35 39]. The CJEU has ruled that habitual residence corresponds to the place which reflects some degree of integration by the child in a social and family environment. This depends on numerous factors including the reasons for the familys stay in the country in question [54]. Four of the justices held that presence was a necessary precursor to residence. A child could not be integrated into the social environment of a place to which his primary carer had never taken him. Lord Hughes, by contrast, would have held that in these circumstances the child acquired the habitual residence of his mother. The CJEU had not had to consider a case with facts as stark as this, where the only reason that the child had been born in a particular place was because the mother had been deprived of her autonomy to choose where to give birth, and if it had been necessary to decide the appeal under the Regulation, the Supreme Court would have made a reference to it [58]. There was however another basis of jurisdiction which was open to the court to exercise in this case. By Article 14 of the Regulation, the common law rules as to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court continue to apply if the child is not habitually resident in a Member State. The Crown retained the ancient power as parens patriae over those who owe it allegiance as British nationals. For most types of order this jurisdiction was removed by the 1986 Act but not for the order for return made in this case [60]. The judge below did not address herself to this basis of jurisdiction and whether it would be appropriate to exercise it. The case should be remitted to the High Court for it to be considered, in the light of the particular circumstances of this case [64 65]. If the court declined to exercise this jurisdiction, it would remain open to the mother to seek a reference to the CJEU on the issue of habitual residence [67]. Lord Hughes in an additional judgment did not accept that it was a minimum legal requirement of habitual residence that there had at some time been physical presence. This was tantamount to a rule when a purely factual enquiry was required. With a very young child the important environment was essentially a family one. Haroons family unit had its habitual residence in England. He therefore would have held that Haroon was habitually resident in England and Wales [93]. \n",

The necessary consequence of this was that the Roll maintained by the Chief Court of Sind was from August 15, 1947, no longer a roll maintained by a High Court within the meaning of the , and any person whose name was entered on the Roll of the Chief Court of Sind ceased to be an advocate for the purposes of section 14 of the , and therefore ceased to have the right under that section to practice in courts of India. In the present case even though the appellant had a right on August 14, 1947, to practice in the courts subordinate to any High Court in India, such a right ceased to exist after the India (Adaptation of Existing Indian Laws) Order, 1947. \n",

The matter was adjourned from time to time and ultimately on April 28, 196o, the petitioner 's applications were rejected on the ground that a scheme of nationalisation including the petitioner 's routes had in the meantime been approved by the Government on April 20, 196o. The petitioner applied under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ quashing the said order and the scheme, on the ground that the Regional Transport Authority was actuated by mala fides and its real purpose in granting the adjournments was to enable the Government to approve of the scheme, and for a direction that the petitioner 's applications for renewal might be disposed of according to law as on the date when they were filed. Held, that the petition must fail. The , does not prescribe any time limit for the disposal of an application for renewal of permits and it cannot be said that the Regional Transport Authority in the instant case acted without jurisdiction in rejecting the applications even though months had elapsed after the permits had expired and notwithstanding that section 62 permitted the issue of no more than one temporary permit. Even so, the relevant provisions of the Act indicate that an application for renewal of a permit has to be disposed of ordinarily before the expiry of the permits or within a reasonable time thereafter. It was, therefore, open to the petitioner, if it was aggrieved by the delay, to ask for a mandamus directing the Authority to dispose of its applications within a reasonable time. Although section 68F(1) of the Act applies only where the State Transport Undertaking applies for a permit in pursuance of an approved scheme, section 68F(2) is not conditioned by any such limitation and the word 'entertain used by it does not refer to an application filed for the renewal of a permit after the approval of the scheme. That word does not connote any time but describes the scope and duty under that clause and only means that the Authority cannot dispose of an application on merits but can reject it as not maintainable either at the time it is filed or thereafter. Statutory bodies are in duty bound to act promptly and efficiently and discharge their functions fairly and without bias even where the Government is interested. The conduct of the Regional Transport Authority, in the instant case, in granting adjournments, not for the reasons they purported to be but to enable the Government to approve of the scheme, must be disapproved. \n",

            "Target: These appeals arise from a common demand for tax by the State from a number of Sugar Mills on the purchase of Sugarcane at a rate regulated by weight and not on value. The Cess under the U.P. Sugarcane Cess Act, 1956 was declared ultra vires which resulted in the enactment of Sugarcane Purchase Tax Act, 1961. In a fiscal sense, the Purchase Tax Act, is a reincarnation of the Cess Act, but in a legislative sense, it is an independent statute with a different source of power, impact and structure. The tax in question is a successor to the Cess which was struck down but jurisprudentially, the levies are different in character and attributes and constitutionally the imposts derive from different legislative entities and have to be tested by different standards. The Act by Section 3 imposes a rate of tax at the rate of Rs. 1.25 paise per quintal of sugarcane purchased by a factory owner, the corresponding rate for a \"unit\" being paise 50. Under Section 3(2) of the Act, the charge is on the purchase transaction payable by the owner of the factory or unit \"on such date\" at such place and in such instalment as may be prescribed. The appellant had challenged the charge of tax. The High Court dismissed the Writ Petition on the ground that the petitioners have not supplied for any period figures of actual prices paid by them, actual quantity of cane crushed, actual quantity of juice derived, actual quantity of sugar produced and their earnings and, therefore, it was not possible to take the view that tax by weight was unfair and inequitable. The High Court further held that tax by weight had fairer relation to the production of sugar by earnings of a factory than tax by price and consequently no one could complain that the impugned provisions treated unequals as equals, Equal crushing attracts equal tax. On appeal to this Court, it was argued on behalf of the appellants that (i) the scheme and sections of the Act are ultra vires (ii) the charge of tax is bad because in its true character it is a legislation in respect of \"Controlled Industry\" and this power belongs exclusively to Parliament under Entry 52 of List I (Seventh Schedule) of the Constitution, (iii) there is discrimination between sugar factories and khandsari units by the impost of differential rates of tax and liability is computed by the weight of the cane as distinguished from its monetary value, there is an inevitable arbitrariness built into the texture of the scheme and (iv) the Act, masked as Purchase Tax, in essence asks for an Excise Duty on sugar manufacture and is, therefore, invalid as colourable legislation. 770 ^ HELD: (i) This Court cannot lose sight of the all India impact when the law is laid down under Article 141 of the Constitution and judgments of this Court are decisional between litigants but declaratory for the nation. The scheme of the Act is simple and workable. It is undisputed that sugar industry is a controlled industry within the meaning of Entry 52, List I of Schedule and therefore, the legislative power of Parliament covers enactments with regard to industries having regard to Article 246(1) of the Constitution. Entry 54 in List II of the Seventh Schedule, empowers the State legislature to legislate for taxes on purchase of goods and so if the Act under consideration is attracted, in pith and substance by this entry, legislative incompetence cannot void the Act. [774 E F, 781 G H, 782 A] (ii) The contention that the charge of tax is bad because in its true character it is a legislation in respect of controlled industry and which power belongs exclusively to Parliament under Entry 52 of List I has no force. Tika Ram 's case deals with the identical question of \"controlled industry ' vis a vis U.P. Legislation regulating Sugarcane supply and purchase under the U.P. Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953. That statute reserved or assigned to sugar factories specified cane purchasing centres for the purpose. This regimentation of sugarcane growers and regulation of cane supplies to specified millers by a State enactment was attached on the precise ground that sugar being a \"controlled industry\" any enactment affecting such industry including the regulation of supplies of raw materials thereto was taboo. The plea was dismissed as specious, and the appeals under this Court 's consideration are a fortiori cases where the rejection of the contention can be more confidently made. [782 C, F H, 783 A] \"Industry\" as a legislative topic has a large and liberal import, true. But what peripherally affects cannot be confused with what goes to the heart. An acquisition of land for sugar mills or of sugar mills may affect the industry but is not an action in the legislative field forbidden for the States. Sales tax on raw materials going to a factory may affect the costing process of the manufacture but is not legislation on industrial process or allied matters. Indeed, if the State Legislature cannot go anywhere near measures which may affect topics reserved for Parliament a situation of reductio ad absurdum may be reached. [780 B C] Ch. Tikka Ram 's case ; Shyamkant Lal , Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company Ltd. followed. (iii) The contention that there is discrimination between sugar factories and khandsari units by the impost of differential rates of tax and that when a purchase tax liability is computed by the weight of the cane as distinguished from its monetary value, there is an inevitable arbitrariness built into the texture of the scheme, has no force. Neither in intent nor in effect is there any discriminatory treatment discernible to the constitutional eye. Price is surely a safe guide but other methods are not necessarily vocational. It depends Practical considerations of the Administration. traditional. practices in the Trade. Other economic pros and cons enter the verdict but, after a judicial generosity is extended to the legislative wisdom, if there is writ on the statute perversity. 'madness ' in the method or gross disparity, judicial credulity may snap and the measure may meet with its funeral. This Court has uniformly held that classi 771 fication for taxation and the application of Article 14, in that context, must be viewed liberally, not meticulously. [786 F H, 787 B D] Murthy Match Works case; , , applied. It is well established that classification is primarily for the legislature and becomes a judicial issue only when the legislation bears on its bosom obvious condemnation by way of caprice or irrationality. [789 A] (iv) The contention that the Act masked as Purchase tax, in essence asks for an Excise Duty on sugar manufacture and is therefore invalid as colourable legislation has no force. Tax on sale of purchase must be on the occurrence of a taxing event of sale transaction. Beyond that is left to the free play of the legislature, subject, of course, to the contra indication about capricious, arbitrary or irrational features. It is a superstition, cultivated by familiarity, to consider that all sales tax must necessarily have nexus with the price of the commodity. Price as basis is not only usual but also safe to avoid uneven, unequal burdens, although it is conceivable that a legislature can regard prices which fluctuate frequently, as too impractical to tailor the purchase tax. It may even be, in rare cases, iniquitous to link purchase tax with price, if more sensible bases can be found. Supposing a legislature classifies sales tax on the basis of human categories and reduces the rate or exempts the tax in respect of abject desuetudes, or starving flood victims or notoriously hazardous habitations, with respect lo necessity of life. Such differentiation cannot be castigated as discrimination out of hand. It is common and commonsense that reliable stand is the price, although in regard to customs duties there are still items levied on the nature of the goods rather than its value in money. For the present, it is sufficient to state that the practice has been to impose purchase tax by weight of cane. Also, in weight of cane, its sucrose content and its price have a close nexus, although, theoretically, they may appear unconnected. Unequals cannot be treated equally since mechanical uniformity may become unmitigated injustice. Khandsari units are cottage industries unlike sugar factories and need legislative succor for survival. Their economy justifies State action, classifying them as apart from factories and we fail to appreciate the flaw in the scheme on this score. [789 F H. 790 A B. F G] Nothing more than prevention of escapement of purchase tax on cane is done and what is done is legitimately incidental to the taxing power. Peripheral similarity between purchase tax and excise levy does not spell essential sameness. Sugarcane tax operates in the neighborhood of sugar excise but proximity is not identity. The tax is only on purchase of cane, not its conversion into sugar. If the miller has his own cane farm and crushes it, he has no purchase tax to pay but cannot escape excise duty if any. Again if cane is purchased by a miller and it is later robbed or destroyed before sugar is manufactured, the State tax is exigible although excise on production is not. A perspicacious appreciation of the implications of purchase and production dispels confusion on this issue. To buy new produce is a step preliminary to manufacture but is not part of manufacture.

            "Target: The wife of appellant 's brother was found aflame in the early hours of 11.6.1975 in the kitchen of her husband 's house. She was taken to hospital and admitted to Burns ward where the doctor in charge (PW 5) examined her and while taking her case history enquired of the injured as to what happened, to which she replied, \"my nanad (sister in law) burnt me\". She had suffered 90% of burns. The nurse (PW 4) was instructed to give treatment. Later another doctor (PW 2) attended on her. When he asked her as to how she had received the burns, she told him that her husband 's sister had burnt her. In reply to his further query, she named the appellant as her tormentor. He made a note of this information by the victim on the police `yadi ' which was sent to him to ascertain if the victim was in a fit condition to make a dying declaration. As her condition deteriorated, the victim was not in a position to make any statement to the police. The investigation culminated in the appellant being charged under section 302, I.P.C. for causing the murder of her brother 's wife by pouring kerosene on her person and setting her aflame. On trial, the Sessions Court held that the deceased had not the requisite mental condition so as to make an acceptable dying declaration, and that her husband was very much near the cot, and hence possibility of tutoring the deceased could not be ruled out. Giving the benefit of doubt it acquitted the appellant. 89 In the State 's appeal against acquittal, a Division Bench of the High Court re appreciated the prosecution evidence and after closely examining the reasons given by the Sessions court, held them thoroughly untenable and not supported by the evidence on record. It set aside the order of acquittal, convicted the accused of murder and sentenced her to imprisonment for life. The appellant accused appealed to this Court challenging in aforesaid conviction and sentence on the ground that the High Court erred in law in holding the view taken by the trial court as less probable. It was contended that the deceased having suffered 90% of burns and her general condition being poor, she was not in a fit mental state to make the dying declaration; that the dying declarations were not in question and answer form; and that the possibility of tutoring the deceased could not be ruled out. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1. A dying declaration is admissible in evidence on the principle of necessity and can form the basis for conviction if it is found to be reliable. While it is in the nature of an exception to the general rule forbidding hearsay evidence, it is admitted on the premiss that ordinarily a dying person will not falsely implicate an innocent person in the commission of a serious crime. It is this premiss which is considered strong enough to set off the need that the maker of the statement should state so on oath and be cross examined by the person who is sought to be implicated. [94H; 95A B] 2.1 Being an independent piece of evidence like any other piece of evidence Neither extra strong nor weak a dying declaration can be acted upon without corroboration if it is found to be otherwise true and reliable, and in order to form the sole basis for conviction without the need for independent corroboration it must be shown that the person making it had the opportunity of indentifying the person implicated and is thoroughly reliable and free from blemish.[95d; 95B] 2.2 If it is found that the maker of the statement was in a fit state of mind and had voluntarily made the statement on the basis of personal knowledge without being influenced by others and the court on strict scrutiny finds it to be reliable, there is no rule of law or even of prudence that such a reliable piece of evidence cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated. [95C] 3.1 In the instant case, since the incident occurred in the early hours of the day, there was possibility of a family member being involved; and as the incident took place in broad day light, there could be no doubt that the deceased had an opportunity to see her tormentor. The deceased told the doctor (PW 5) that her `nanad ' had set her on fire. Since the appellant was the only sister of her husband, there remained no doubt about the identity of the `nanad ' (husband 's sister or sister in law). Doubt, if any, was removed by another doctor 's evidence (PW 2) to whom she disclosed the name of the appellant. [95D, 94D, 95F G] 3.2 The mere fact that the deceased had suffered 90% burns and her general condition was poor, was no reason to discard the testimony of both the medical men when they said that she was in a fit state of mind and was able to make the dying declarations in question. Both the doctors were conscious of her condition and would not have attached any importance to her statement if they had any doubt about her mental capacity. Besides the oral evidence of the two medical men, there were contemporaneous documents showing that the deceased made the statements in question. [96E; 95G; 94G] Suresh vs State of M.P., , relied on. 3.3 The doctors (PW 2 and PW 5) merely questioned the victim for the limited purpose of recording the case history. Having regard to her condition, they could not have questioned her in detail. In the circumstances, the fact of the statements being cryptic was understandable; and the failure on their part to record her statements in question and answer form could in no manner affect the probative value to be attached to their evidence. [97A B; 96G] Bankey lal vs State of U.P., , relied on and Rabi Chandra Padhan & Ors. vs State of Orissa, , held inapplicable. Being conscious of the fact that while dealing with an acquittal appeal, the court should give due weight to the views of the trial court on the question of credibility of the prosecution evidence and should not lightly interfere with its appreciation, the High Court carefully scrutinised the evidence, particularly in regard to the two oral dying declarations, and rightly concluded that there was no possibility of tutoring nor was the deceased mentally unfit to make the said dying declarations.

In view of the disparity in payment of wages and neglect on the part of the Corporation regarding the regularisation of the services of the daily rated workmen there arose an industrial dispute and the dispute was referred by the competent authority for adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal No. 3, Delhi under a notification dated 23.11.1987. The Tribunal passed an award nearly six years after the date of the reference that the workmen concerned were not entitled to be regularised as vaccinators/ Immunisors in the scale of Rs.260 430.

            "Target: The legislative history in regard to the subject of capital punishment shows that there has been a significant change in thinking and approach Since India became free. Prior to the amendment of section 367(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure by Act 26 of 1955, the normal rule was to impose sentence of death on a person convicted for murder and if a lesser sentence was to be imposed, the Court was required to record reasons in writing. But by Act 26 of 1955, this provision in section 367(5) was omitted with the result that the Court became free to award either death sentence or life imprisonment, and no longer was death sentence the rule and life imprisonment the exception. Then again a further progress was made in the same direction by section 354(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. That section provides that when the conviction is for an offence punishable with death or in the alternative with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years, the judgment shall state the reasons for the sentence awarded and, in the case of sentence of death, the special reasons for such sentence. The unmistakable shift in the legislative emphasis is that for murder, life imprisonment should be the rule and capital punishment the exception to be resorted to only for special reasons. It is only where, in view of the peculiar facts and circumstances, there are special reasons that the death sentence may be awarded: otherwise life sentence offence would certinly be \"too young.\" [277G; E, F] The seminal trends in current sociological thinking and penal strategy tempered as they are by humanistic attitude and deep concern for the worth of the human person, frown upon death penalty and regard it as cruel and savage punishment to be inflicted only in exceptional cases. [276G] In the instant case the appellant was charged with an offence of murder by severing the head of the deceased from the body and then carrying it away in a most brutal and inhuman manner. The trial court convicted and sentenced him to death. Both the conviction and sentence were upheld by the High Court. On the question of sentence, Allowing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: The appellant was just around 16 years of age at the time when he committed the offence and, therefore, he would be entitled to the clemency of penal justice. It would not be appropriate to impose the extreme penalty of death. Taking into account the current sociological and juristic thinking as could be seen from the recommendation of the Law Commission which appears to have been incorporated in the Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Bill 1972, it would be legitimate for the Court to refuse to impose death sentence on an accused convicted of murder, if it finds that at the time of the commission of the offence the appellant was under 18 years of age. A murderer who is below 18 years of age at the time of commission of the offence would certainly be \"too young.\" [277G; E, F] E.

The suit was decreed and the Zamindar took possession of the land. Ramprasad filed an appeal before the Additional Commissioner but the same was dismissed . He preferred a second appeal before the Board of Revenue during the pendency of which the matter was compromised whereunder he was recognised as tenant of the land in dispute and the order of eviction was; thus nullified. He applied for restitution of possession under section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The application was resisted by Dataram and others who had been inducted as tenants on these plots of land during the pendency of the appeals. The trial court allowed the application but its order was reversed by the Additional Commissioner who held that the newly inducted tenants could not be dispossessed. Its order was affirmed by the Board of Revenue in revision. Thereafter fie filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court challenging the decision of the Board of Revenue, but that petition was dismissed on merits. No appeal was attempted to be filed against the order of the High Court either by applying for a certificate or moving this Court for special leave under article 136. The appellants have instead come to this Court in appeal by special leave against the order of the Board of Revenue.

Rule 6 of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules, 1960 (which were applicable to the proceedings in the Gujarat High Court) provided for joint appeals by persons aggrieved by a common judgment or order. There was however no, rule specifically providing for similar joint appeals by the State. A Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the joint appeal by the State against the respondents on the ground that such an appeal was not maintainable. The Division Bench held that the decision by a Full Beach of the High Court in Lalu lela 's case in which a contrary view had been taken was not binding on the Division Bench. In appeal to this Court against the judgment of the Division Bench. HELD : (i) The Division Bench was in error in not treating as binding the earlier decision of a Full Bench of the same court on the same question. 1877 A F] Mahadeolal Kanodia vs The Administrator General of West Bengal, ; , Jai Kaur & Ors. vs Sher Singh etc. , Atma Ram vs State of Punjab & Ors. , Jaisri Sahu vs Rai Dewan, [19621 2 S.C.R. 559 and Budha Singh vs Laltu Singh, I.L.R. 37 All. 604 (P.C.), applied. (ii) Rule 6 of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules does not in terms cover the case of an appeal by the State against several accused persons jointly tried and acquitted by the trial court by a common order, but if an appeal by persons jointly tried and convicted is competent, then on principle it is difficult to negative the maintainability of one appeal by the State against a common order acquitting several persons tried jointly. Like all rules of procedure this rule demands a construction which would ' promote the cause of justice and not obstruct it. (878 D F] A joint appeal by the State against several accused persons acquitted at a joint trial is not contrary to any provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure and is therefore not legally prohibited. Sections 258, 410, 417, 419 or 423 of the Code do not indicate any bar as was suggested by the order of the High Court. Indeed the plain reading of section 417 which pro%ides for an appeal in a case and not against an accused person, seems to be wide enough to permit ,A joint appeal. The matter being one of mere form it calls for a liberal approach requiting the appeal to be beard on its merits. The order of the High Court must accordingly be set aside.

            "Target: In order to put the sugar industry on a stable footing, for which it was necessary to develop the cane area, the Ruler of the erstwhile Gwalior State by an order dated 27 7 1946 sanctioned the levy of cess of one anna per maund on all sugar cane purchased by the respondent company. When the Government of Madhya Bharat, which was the successor state of the former Gwalior State, made a demand for payment of the cess, the respondent filed a petition before the High Court of Madhya ,Bharat challenging the legality of the levy on the grounds (1) that the order dated 27 7 1946 was only an executive order and not a law under article 265 of the Constitution of India and that, therefore, there was no authority for the imposition of the cess after January 26, 1950, and (2) that the levy was discriminatory and violated article 14 inasmuch as while the respondent was made liable to pay the cess the other sugar factories in the State were exempt. It was found that at the time when cess was first levied there was no sugar factory in existence in the Gwalior State other than that of the respondent. Held, that (i) the Ruler of an Indian State was an absolute monarch in which there was no constitutional limitation to act in any manner he liked, he being the supreme legislature, the supreme judiciary and the supreme head of the executive. I Consequently, the order dated 27 7 1946 issued by the Ruler of Gwalior State amounted to a law enacted by him and became an existing law under article 372 of the Constitution of India. The levy of cess was therefore by authority of law within the meaning of article 265; Madhaorao Phalke vs The State of Madhya Bharat, ; , followed. (2) the levy of cess did not contravene article 14 because (a) the object was cane development in the particular area and a geographical classification based upon historical factors was a permissible mode of classification, and (b) a tax could not be struck down as discriminatory unless it was found that it was imposed with a deliberate intention of differentiating between 620 (ii) where the order is passed by the Sub divisional Animal Husbandry Officer, under sub rule (5), to the District Animal Husbandry Officer and (iii) where the order is passed by the authority prescribed under sub rule (1) to the Sub divisional Animal Husbandry Officer, if there is one; if not, to the District Animal Husbandry Officer; (b) The appeal shall not be decided against the appellant unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of being heard. \" The argument on behalf of the petitioners is that they are \"Kassais\" by profession and they earn their living by slaughtering cattle only (not goats or sheep which are slaughtered by \"Chiks\"); that they have the fundamental right to carry on their profession and trade; and that section 3 of the Act read with r. 3 imposes unreasonable restrictions restrictions not in the interests of the general public on their fundamental right and therefore they are not saved by cl. (6) of article 19 of the Constitution. Some of these arguments were considered by this Court in Md. Hanif Quareshi vs The State of Bihar (1) and it was pointed out that the test of reasonableness should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard, or general pattern, of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases. It referred to the decision in State of Madras vs V. G. Row (2) and repeated what was said therein that \"the nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should all enter into the judicial verdict.\" 'Another consideration which has to be kept in mind is that \"the legislature is the best judge of what is good for the community,. by whose suffrage it comes into existence. . . . (See The State of Bihar vs Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga (3)). But the ultimate responsibility for determining the validity of the law must rest with the (1) (2) ; (3) 621 Court and the Court must not shirk that solemn duty cast on it by the Constitution. We must, therefore, approach the problem before us in the light of the principles laid down by this Court. The most pertinent question is having regard to all the relevant circumstances, is the age of 25 years laid down in section 3 a reasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners in the interests of the general public ? We are unable to say that it is. Apart from the affidavits made on behalf of the petitioners and the respondent State, a large volume of authoritative and expert opinion has been placed before us which shows beyond any doubt that a bull, bullock or she buffalo does not remain useful after 14 or 15 years and only a few of them live up to the age of 25. In the Report of the Cattle Preservation and Development Committee, published by the Ministry of Agriculture, it is recommended by the Committee that the slaughter of animals over 14 years of age and unfit for work as also animals of any age permanently unable to work owing to injury or deformity, should be allowed. In the Report on the Marketing of Meat in India (published by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture) there is a reference to a draft Bill circulated by the Ministry of Agriculture (page 112 of the Report) which contains a clause that animals over 14 years of age and unfit for work may be slaughtered on a certificate from a Veterinary Officer. In the Report on the Marketing of Cattle in India, again published by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, occurs the following passage as to the price of animals with reference to their age: \"Young draught animals up to the age of 4 years being raw and untrained fetch comparatively low prices. Between 4 and 8 years of age, the animals are in the prime of their youth and tender best service, and fetch maximum prices. From the 8th year onwards old age sets in, and a graded decline is observed in their capacity to work and consequently prices depreciate considerably.\" . In a Food and Agricultural Organisation study of cattle in India and Pakistan (Zebu Cattle of India and 79 622 Pakistan, page 94) it is stated that the active breeding life of a bull is estimated to be about 10 years. In Black 's Veterinary Dictionary (edited by W. C. Miller and G. P. West, fifth edition) it is stated that pedigree ,bulls may reach 12 or 14 years of age before being discarded; and cattle seldom live longer than 15 or 16 years, and when they do, their age is usually of no immediate importance. In another publication of the Ministry of Agriculture called 'Problems of Cattle Insurance ' under Indian conditions, it is stated that the life of cattle is comparatively much shorter, the maximum age being only about 15 years. There is an interesting chart relating to the determination of age in cattle in a publication called 'Cattle Development in Uttar Pradesh ' by R. L. Kaura, Director of Animal Husbandry; that chart shows that at II years incisors appear smaller due to wearing out; at 12 years space appears between the teeth, and after 12 teeth wear out constantly and roots remain far apart from one another. As against all this expert opinion the respondent State has relied on the chart embodying some useful data about domestic animals, prepared by Major A. C. Aggarwala, Director of Veterinary Services, Punjab, and R. R. Gulati, Superintendent, Veterinary Department, Jullandur, which shows the sterility age of a buffalo at 15 and average age at 25, and of a cow sterility at 15 and 16 years and average life 22 years. \n",

Section 3(1)(g) of the Act imposes a limitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right to slaughter the animal. Under the rule the prescribed authority for the purpose of section 3(3) consists of the Veterinary Officer and the Chairman or Chief Officer of a District Board, Municipality etc. Unless both of them concur, no certificate for slaughter can be granted.

            "Target: This appeal is directed against the order of the Gujarat High Court upholding the order dated the 15th November, 1977 passed by the State of Gujarat whereby the amounts of gratu ity and pension payable to the appellant on superannuation were reduced by 50 per cent. The appellant was born on January 15, 1909 and after obtaining a Degree in Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) joined the service in the former State of Junagarh and as such was governed by the Junagadh State Pension and Parwashi Allow ances Rules of 1932 which were duly codified and published in the Junagadh State Account Code, State of Junagadh was integrated into the State of Saurashtra on 20.1.1949 and the services of the appellant were absorbed in the State of Saurashtra. The conditions of service of the absorbed serv ants were duly protected and a proclamation providing a guarantee that the service conditions of absorbed servants could not be varied to their disadvantage was issued on 20.1.49 that being the date of merger of the State. The State of Saurashtra made the Saurashtra Covenanting State Servants (Superannuation Age) Rules, 1955. Rule 3(i) thereof provided that a Government servant shall, unless for special reasons otherwise directed by Government retire from service on his completing 55 years of age. After the merger of the State of Saurashtra with State of Bombay the old Bombay Civil Service Rules, 1959 were made applicable to Saurashtra area and on 1.7.59 the Bombay Civil Service Rules, 1959 were promulgated. As per clause (c)(2)(ii)(1) of Rule 161, Government servants in the Bombay Service of Engineers Class I were to retire on reaching the age of 55 years. 215 The appellant was compulsorily retired by the State on 12.10.1961 with effect from 12.1.1962 when he had completed the age of 53 years. The appellant challenged that order by means of writ before the High Court and having remained unsuccessful he took up the matter before this Court and this Court by its judgment dated 9.4.69 allowed the appeal and declared that the appellant was entitled to remain in service until he attained the age of 55 years and that the impugned order compulsorily retiring him at the age of 53 years was invalid and ineffective. In order to give effect to this Court 's order mentioned above, the Government of Gujarat on 4.8.69 intimated the appellant that he will be deemed to have remained in service uptil 14.1.64, when he attained the age of 55 years. as he had attained that age prior to the decision of this Court. In the meantime the age of superannuation of the employ ees of the State of Gujarat had been raised from 55 years to 58 years. The appellant in order to take benefit of the change moved a writ petition before the High Court of Guja rat but remained unsuccessful. Thereupon he filed a special leave petition before this Court. This Court by its order dated 21.7.1975 declined to interfere. Thus the appellant was not entitled to continue in service beyond 55 years of age. It may be mentioned that prior to his compulsory retire ment there were three departmental inquiries pending against the appellant, on grounds of slackness in supervision. overpayment to contractors and loss to the Government and payment in advance of the receipt of goods. The first in quiry was initiated on 6.2.61. second on 11.4.1963 and the third on 17.8.63. These inquiries remained pending against the appellant till 1971. The appellant filed yet another Special Civil Applica tion No. 504 of 1971 before the High Court praying for issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State to pay to the appellant all his outstanding salary. allowances. including due increments after the efficiency bar from 12.1. 1902 to 14.1. 1964 together with 6% interest. An application for interim relief was also filed but was withdrawn later on the representation perhaps made by the State that the enquiries had become infructuous consequent to appellant 's retirement. In the meanwhile the State of Gujarat issued a show cause notice dated 17.7.1971 to the appellant intimating him that the Government 216 considered his service record and did not find the same thoroughly satisfactory for the reasons mentioned in the said notice and accordingly the Government proposed to make 50% reduction both in the payment of Gratuity and Pension admissible to him. The appellant submitted his reply and these proceedings due to laches on the part of the appellant went on for a considerable time and the Government passed the final order on 15.11.1977 reducing the Pension and Gratuity by 50 per cent. To challenge this Order the appellant again filed Spe cial Civil Application before the High Court for quashing the order reducing his Pension and gratuity. The High Court dismissed the application in limine on 8.3.1978 observing that in the present case the Government recorded reasons why it came to the conclusion that the petitioner 's Service was unsatisfactory and therefore, put a proportionate cut in the Pension. as no case of discrimination was made out. The appellant, preferred Letters Patent Appeal. against the order passed by the Single Judge. His contention before the Division Bench was that he continued to be governed by the Junagadh Rules in spite of the fact that the Bombay Rules were sought to be made applicable to him. His alternative contention was that even if the Bombay Rules were to be made applicable, so far as the question of payment was concerned, inasmuch as they were not less advantageous on compulsory retirement. proportionate pension was payable to the appel lant under the Bombay Rules of 1959. The Division Bench held that under either set of Rules, it was open to the State Government to reduce the amount of pension payable to the petitioner as his service had not been found satisfactory by the State under Junagadh Rules as also under Bombay Civil Service Rules. The High Court accordingly dismissed the Letter Patent Appeal. Hence this appeal. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the High Court went wrong in upholding the impugned order reduc ing the amounts of pension & gratuity in exercise of its power under Rules 188 and 189 of the Bombay Rules, as it had already been ruled by this Court in its judgment in Civil Appeal No. 409 of 1966, that Bombay Rules could not be made applicable to the appellant. It was urged that the appellant was not governed by Saurashtra Rules either, and it was asserted that either in the show cause notice or in the impugned order. it Is nowhere specifically stated as to under what set of Rules, the impugned order Imposing a cut in the Pension or Gratuity has been passed. A contention was also raised based on clauses 3, 13 & 15 of Rule 241 A of Junagadh Rules stating that they operate in different fields. It was added that no inquiry as contemplated under Rule 189 had been made and admittedly the State had stated before the High Court that 217 the departmental inquiries had become infructuous consequent upon the retirement of the appellant. According to the counsel for the State the appellant having been retired in pursuance of a judicial order passed by this Court, he cannot now be heard that his retirement at the age of 55 years should be construed as compulsory re tirement the superannuation age having been increased to 60 years under Junagadh Rules, that the retirement of the appellant is normal one; he was entitled to pension under Rule 241 of the Junagadh Rules and the State has passed the impugned order after complying with the provisions of Rules or gratuity be not reduced. Dismissing the appeal. this Court, HELD: Rules 188 and 189 have expressly preserved the State Government 's power to reduce or withhold pension by taking proceedings against a Government Servant even after his retirement. [229H; 230A] In the instant case, in accordance with the procedure specified in Note I to Rule 33 of the Bombay Civil Services Conduct, Discipline and Appeal Rules a show cause notice had been issued to the appellant on 17.7.71 calling upon him to show cause within 30 days from the date of the receipt of the notice as to why the proposed reduction should not be made in the Pension and death cum retirement gratuity. The appellant failed to avail that opportunity to disprove the allegations and satisfy his appointing authority that he rendered satisfactory service throughout. It was in those circumstances the appointing authority thought fit to impose reduction on the Pension and gratuity in accordance with Rules 188 and 189 of the Bombay Rules on the ground that the appellant had not rendered satisfactory service. The appel lant is not entitled to take advantage of clause (b)(ii) of the proviso to Rule 189 A since the proceedings had been instituted long before his retirement. Further as per clause (a) of the said proviso the proceedings were already insti tuted long before his retirement. Further as per clause (a) of the said proviso, the proceedings already instituted while the Government servant was in service could be contin ued and concluded even after his retirement. Therefore the order dated 15.11.1977 reducing the pension and gratuity cannot be said to contravene the Bombay Rules. [231A E] A combined reading of clauses 3, 13 and 15 of Rule 241 A of 218 Junagadh Rules shows that clause 3 is an exception to the general scheme laid down in clauses 13 and 15. [228C] Bholanath J.

The High Court dismissed the writ petition negativing the claim, against which, this appeal by special leave was filed. Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD 1. Section 135 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 gets saved under Article 285(1) of the Constitution itself. The said Article provides that property of the Union shall, save in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, be exempt from all taxes imposed by the State or by any authority within a State. [185 A B] 2. Section 1315 of the Railways Act permits taxation of Railways by the local authority in the manner given therein; the Central Government being the controlling and the regu lating authority permitting liability at a given point of time, its extent and manner. The Indian Railways Act being a central enactment has no role to play in sub Article (2) of Article 285, for that is a sphere in which the State legis lation operates. [186 A B] 3. The reasoning of the High Court to oust the applica bility of Section 135 of the Indian Railways Act on the test of sub Article (2) of Article 285 was totally misplaced, as also in not venturing to create room for it in sub Article (1) of Article 285.

            "Target: The Mines and Minerals (Regulation & Development) Act, 1957 (Central Act) was enacted in the public interest to enable the Union to take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals. Exercising its power under this Act, the Central Government declared by a notification that black granite was a minor mineral. Exercising power vested in it by section 15 of the Act, the State Government made the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1959. Rule 8 of the Rules prescribes the procedure for lease of quarries to private persons. By rule 8 C, introduced in 1977, leases for quarrying black granite in favour of private persons were banned. Sub rule (2) of this rule enacts that the State Government themselves may engage in quarrying black granite or grant leases for quarrying black granite in favour of any corporation wholly owned by the State Government. Several applications for the grant of fresh leases as well as for the renewal of leases for quarrying black granite belonging to the State Government were submitted to the State Government, some prior to the introduction of rule 8C and some after the rule came into force. The State Government considered all the applications and rejected all of them in view of rule 8C. The respondents filed writ petition questioning the vires of Rule 8 C on various grounds. The High Court struck down Rule 8 C on the ground that it exceeded the rule making power given to the State Government and held that it was not open to the appellant Government to keep the applications pending for a long time and then to dispose them of on the basis of a rule which had come into force later. As a result all the applications were disposed of without reference to rule 8 C. The appellant contended that: (I) The approach of the High Court was vitiated by its failure to notice the crucial circumstance that the minerals belonged to the Government, (II) The respondents had no vested or indefeasible right to obtain a lease or a renewal to quarry the minerals, (III) There were good reasons for banning the grant of lease to quarry black granite to private parties and (IV) The Government could not be compelled to grant leases which would result in the destruction of the mineral resources of the country. On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that (I) the question of ownership of the minerals was irrelevant, (II) It was not open to the appellant 743 to exercise its subordinate legislative function in a manner to benefit itself as owner of the minerals, nor was it open to the appellant to create monopoly by such means, (III) There was violation of articles 301 and 303 of the Constitution, (IV) Rule 8 C had no application to renewals and (V) That in any event it would not have the effect of affecting applications made more than 60 days before it came into force. Accepting the appeals, it was ^ HELD: Rule 8 C was made in bonafide exercise of the rule making power of the Appellant Government and not in its misuse to advance its own self interest. Making a rule which is perfectly in order is not to be considered a misuse of the rule making power, if it advances the interest of State, which really means the people of the State. Rivers, forests, minerals and as such other resources constitute a nation 's natural wealth. These resources are not to be frittered away and exhausted by any one generation. Every generation owes a duty to all succeeding generations to develop & conserve the natural resources of the nation in the best possible way. It is in the interest of mankind. It is in the interest of the Nation. It is recognised by Parliament. Parliament has declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals. [751C D, 753G H] 2. The Public interest which induced Parliament to make the declaration contained in S.2 of the Mines & Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 has naturally to be the paramount consideration in all matters concerning the regulation of Mines & Minerals. Parliament 's Policy is clearly discernible from the provisions of the Act. It is the conservation and the prudent and discriminating exploitation of minerals, with a view to secure maximum benefit to the community. There are clear sign posts to lead and guide the subordinate legislating authority in the matter of the making of rules. [751G H] 3. The other provisions of the Act, particularly sections 4A, 17 and 18, indicate that the rule making authority under S.15 has not exceeded its powers in banning leases for carrying black granite in favour of private parties and in stipulating that the State Government themselves may engage in quarrying black granite or grant leases for quarrying black granite in favour of any corporation wholly owned by the State Government. To view such a rule made by the Subordinate legislating body as a rule made to benefit itself merely because the State Government happens to be the subordinate legislating body is, but, to take too narrow a view of the functions of that body. [751H, 752A B] H. C. Narayanappa & Ors. vs State of Mysore & Ors. ; @ 745, 752 753 referred to. Whenever there is a switch over from 'private sector ' to 'public sector ' it does not necessarily follow that a change of policy requiring express legislative sanction is involved. It depends on the subject and the statute. But if a decision is taken to ban private mining of a single minor mineral for the purpose of conserving it, such a ban, if it is otherwise within the bounds of the authority given to the Government by the Statute, cannot be said to involve any change of policy. The policy of the Act remains the same and it is, the conservation and the prudent and discriminating exploitation of 744 minerals, with a view to secure maximum benefit to the community. Exploitation of minerals by the private and/or the public sector is contemplated. If in the pursuit of the avowed policy of the Act, it is thought exploitation by the public sector is best and wisest in the case of a particular mineral and, in consequence, the authority competent to make the subordinate legislation makes a rule banning private exploitation of such mineral, which was hitherto permitted. There is no change of policy merely because that was previously permitted is no longer permitted.

The restrictions, freedom from which is guaranteed by article 301 would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade. The Act and the rules properly made thereunder are, therefore, outside the purview of article 301. Even otherwise article 302 which enables Parliament, by law, to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest also furnishes an answer to the claim based on the alleged contravention of article 301. [757F H, 758A B] 7. The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act is a law enacted by Parliament and declared by Parliament to be expedient in the public interest. Rule 8 C has been made by the appellant Govt. by notification in the official Gazette, pursuant to the power conferred upon it by sec. 15 of the Act. A statutory rule, while ever subordinate to the parent statute, is, otherwise, to be treated as part of the statute and as effective. \"Rules made under the Statute must be treated for all purposes of construction or obligation exactly as if they were in the Act and are to be of the same effect as if contained in the act and are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction or obligation. [758B G] Atiabari Tea Co. Ltd. vs State of Assam & Ors. ; The Automobile Transport Rajasthan Ltd., vs State of Rajasthan & Ors. [1963] 1 SCR 491 and State of U.P. & Ors. vs Babu Ram Upadhya ; , referred to. Rule 9 makes it clear that a renewal is not to be obtained automatically, for the mere asking. The applicant for the renewal has, particularly, to satisfy the Government that the renewal is in the interests of mineral development and that the lease amount is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. These conditions have to be fulfilled in addition to whatever criteria is applicable at the time of the grant of lease in the first instance, suitably adapted, of course, to grant of renewal. Not to apply the criteria applicable in the first instance may lead to absurd results. Therefore rule 8 C is attracted in considering applications for renewal of leases also. [759A D] 9. While the applications should be dealt with within a reasonable time, it cannot on that account be said that the right to have an application disposed 745 of in a reasonable time clothes an applicant for a lease with a right to have the application disposed of on the basis of the rules in force at the time of the making of the application. No one has a vested right to the grant or renewal of a lease and none can claim a vested right to have an application for the grant or renewal of a lease dealt with in a particular way, by applying particular provisions. In the absence of any vested rights in any one, an application for a lease has necessarily to be dealt with according to the rules in force on the date of the disposal of the application despite the fact that there is a long delay since the making of the application. [759G H, 760A] 10. The language of Rule 8 C is clear that it can not have any application to lands in which the right to minerals belongs to the applicants themselves. In the case of lands in which the right to minerals belongs to private owners and those owners seek permission to quarry black granite the applications will have to be dealt with under the relevant rules in Sec. III of the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral concession Rules. Rule 8 C does not impose a general ban on quarrying black granite but only imposes a bar on the grant of leases for quarrying black granite.

            "Prediction: The State Government on a request made by the Central Government in the interest of regulation of mines and mineral development to terminate a mining lease pre maturely and grant a fresh mining lease in favour of a Government Company or Corporation owned or controlled by Government. The State Government, by a notification in the Official Gazette, declared that it was expedient in the public interest that the Union should take under its control the regulation of Mines and the development of minerals to the extent thereafter provided. Section 4 to 9A are grouped under the heading 'General Restrictions on undertaking prospecting and mining operations '. These provisions as well as Sections 10 to 13 are made inapplicable to'minor minerals'by section 14. section 4 prohibits all prospecting or mining operations except under a licence or a lease granted under the Act and the rules made thereunder.

Not merely idols or sacred books, but any other object which is regarded as sacred by any class of persons, whether actually worshipped or not, fall within the description. Queen Empress vs Imam Ali, All. 150 and Romesh Chunder Sannyal vs Hiru Mondal, Cal. 852, considered. Consequently, in a case where the allegation in the petition of complaint was that one of the accused broke the idol of God Ganesa in public and the two others actually aided and abetted him with the intention of insulting the religious feeling of the complainant and his community who held the deity in veneration and the trial Magistrate, on receipt of the Police report that the alleged occurrence was true, dismissed the complaint under section 203 of the Code of Criminal Procedure holding that the breaking of a mud image of Ganesa was not an offence under section 295 of the Indian Penal Code and the Sessions judge and the High Court in revision, agreeing with the view of the trial Court, refused to direct further enquiry : Held, that the courts below were clearly in error in inter preting section 295 of the Indian Penal Code in the way they (lid, but since the complaint stood long dismissed, no further enquiry need be directed into the matter. Held, further, that the Courts must be circumspect in such matters and pay due regard to the religious susceptibilities of different classes of persons with different beliefs, whether they shared those beliefs or not or whether those beliefs in the opinion of the Court were rational or not. \n",
            "Prediction: The first accused was the leader of Dravida Kazakam (a community of persons who profess to be religious reformers, one of whose creeds is to carry on propaganda against idol worship), and as such, was out to vilify a certain section of the Hindu community by breaking an idol of God Ganesa in public at the Town Hall Maidan. The said act of breaking the idol was alleged to have been actively abetted by instigation and aid by the other two accused persons, who also made speeches. The petition of complaint alleged that the first accused had committed a prima facie offence under section 295 of the Indian Penal Code, and that the acts complained of amounted to offences under sections 295 and 295A of the Code. The High Court dismissed the complaint under section 203 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

            "Target: The respondent assessee was a partner in the partnership firms of M/s. Malabar Tile Works and M/s. Malabar Plywood Works and alongwith her there were other partners including her husband and minor daughter. In her returns for the assessment year 1964 65 for which the relevant accounting year was the calendar year ending 31st December, 1963, the assessee filed a return of income omitting the amounts representing the shares of her husband and minor daughter in the partnership firms from her income. The Income Tax Officer, however, brought the amounts, namely, Rs. 59,506 to tax and referred the case for taking action under section 271(1)(c) of the Act to the Assistant Appellate Commissioner who imposed a penalty of namely, Rs. 7,000 on the assessee for having concealed her income. In appeal the Tribunal set aside the order and the High Court on reference affirmed the Tribunal 's order. Hence the appeal by Revenue to this Court after obtaining special leave. Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: (1) The assessee, in view of the fact that the prescribed form for filing of returns under section 139 of the Act, prior to 31st March, 1972, did not contain separate column to show \"income arising to spouse/minor child or any other person referred to in Chapter V of the Act\", and in view of the decision of three Judges Bench reported in SC could not be said to have concealed her income by not disclosing in the return filed by her the amounts representing the shares of her husband and minor daughter in the two partnership firms. [788B] (2) The term \"his income\" for the purpose of section 271(1)(c) of the Act, is \"his income\" which the assessee is liable to disclose for the purposes of assessment and yet fails to do so. The return of income under section 139(1) of the Act is required to be filed in order to enable the Revenue Authorities to make a proper assessment of tax on the assessee. A fortiorari, it follows that the assessee must disclose in the return every item of income which is liable to be taxed in his hands under sections 4 & 5 of the Act. [785B; F H] 782 (3) The definition of \"total income\" in section 2(45), no doubt refers to section 5 which lays down that all the income profits and gains accrued or arisen to the assessee or received by or on behalf of the assessee shall be liable to be included in his total income but this provision is subject to the other provisions of the Act and therefore if the income of any other person is declared by any provision of the Act to be includible in computing the total income of the assessee, such income would form part of the total income exigible to tax under section 4 of the Act. section 64(1) is one such provision which provides for inclusion of the income of certain other persons in computing the total income of the assessee. [785F H] Section 64(1) makes it clear that though the share of the spouse or minor child in the profits of a partnership firm in which the assessee is a partner is not the income of the assessee but is the income of such spouse or minor child it is liable to be included in computing the total income of the assessee and it would be assessable to tax in the hands of the assessee. The total income of the assessee chargeable to tax would include the amounts representing the shares of the spouse and minor child in the profits of the partnership firm. Obviously the words \"his income\" in section 139 sub section (1) must include every item of income which goes to make up his total income assessable under the Act. The amounts representing the shares of the spouse and minor child in the profits of the partnership firm would be part of \"his income\" for the purpose of assessment to tax and would have to be shown in the return of income filed by him. [786B D] (4) It is true that the form of the return prescribed by Rule 12 of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 which was in force during the relevant assessment year did not contain any separate column for showing the income of the spouse and minor child liable to be included in the total income of the assessee, but it did contain a Note stating that if the income of any other person is includible in the total income of the assessee under the provisions, inter alia, of section 64, such income should also be shown in the return under the appropriate head. This Note clearly required the assessee to show in the return under the appropriate head of income, namely, \"profits and gains of business or profession\" the amounts representing the shares of the husband and minor daughter of the assessee in the profits of the two partnership firms. The assessee however failed to disclose these amounts in the return submitted by her and there was plainly and manifestly a breach of the obligation imposed by section 139 sub section (1) requiring the assessee to furnish a return of her income in the prescribed form. To accept the contention that despite the Note the assessee was still not liable to show in the return the amounts representing the shares of her husband and minor daughter in the two partnership firms would render the Note meaningless and futile and turn it into a dead letter 783 and that would be contrary to all recognised canons of construction. The assessee was guilty of concealment of this item of income which plainly attracted the applicability of section 271 sub section (1) clause (c). [786G 787D] V.D.M.RM.M.RM.

In disputes arising bet the appellant and the respondents the Industrial Tribunal had to deal with questions relating to dearness allowance, classification of grades and fixation of wages and the incentive bonus scheme as modified 'by the company. In appeal against the award of the Tribunal, HELD : (i) The decisions of this Court in Gramophone Company Ltd. vs its Workmen and The Indian Link Chain Manufacturers Ltd. vs Their Workmen show that the Tribunal was justified in computing gross profits without deducting taxation, depreciation and development rebate. The latter decision is directly in point to the effect that provision for depre ciation cannot be deducted.

The object of industrial adjudication is to secure as far as possible uniformity of service conditions among industrial units in the same region,. if a concern having foreign collaboration properly satisfies the tests of comparability it would be improper to regard such unit as uncomparable merely on the ground that it is a concern with foreign collaboration or interest and that the unit with which it is sought to be compared is entirely of Indian origin and resources.

Burroughk Wellcome & Co. as a unit comparable with the appellant. 568 The fact that Burroughs Wellcome employed a lesser labour force did not deserve much importance because the business performance of the two companies was equal. Once Burroughs Wellcome Co. was treated as a comparable unit the wage scales awarded by the Tribunal could not be considered to be unjustified.

If the Order materially affects the prosperity of the appellant 's trade it would be open to it to raise a dispute for the reduction in the wage structure and in case they are able to show that in view of the Drugs (Price Control) Order their financial position has weakened to such an extent that they cannot bear the burden of the wage structure fixed by the present award, the matter may have to be examined on its merits.

[60OC D] (vii)There were different systems of dearness allowance for the operators and the clerical and subordinate staff in the appellant company. That such a different system of dearness allowance for employees working under the same employer is not warranted is clear from the decisions of this Court in the cases of Greaves Cotton & Co. and Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. Therefore the Tribunal was justified in devising a uniform scale of dearness allowance applicable to all the employees of the appellant.

(viii)From the date of the settlement in 1966 the cost of living index had very rapidly gone up by 220 points. At the time when the demand for revision of wages scales and dearness allowance was made by the Unions and when the reference order was made by the Government, the cost of living index had gone up very high. That clearly showed that the workmen bad made out a case for revision of wage scales and dearness allowance.

Held that the statements could not be said to undermine the security of the State or friendly relations with foreign States nor did they amount to contempt of Court or defamation prejudicial to the security of the State nor did they tend to overthrow the State and that the prosecution had failed to establish that the act of the appellants undermined public order, decency or morality or was tant amount to an incitement to an offence prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and consequently the prosecution under section 9 was not justified. Public men may as well think it worth their while to ignore such vulgar criticisms and abuses hurled against them, rather than give importance to the same by prosecuting the person responsible for the same.

The procession started from Gul Park and was taken on lorries and jeeps. It stopped near Chitra Talkies and then started on foot. When it reached Prabhat Studio, the appellants raised slogans \"Jaggu mama hai hai\" and \"Khachar Khota hai\", which besides being indecent amounted to defamation and was pre judicial to the security of the State and the maintenance of public order. The appellants filed a Revision Application before the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla but the same was summarily dismissed by the learned Chief Justice.

            "Target: The prosecution alleged that the police officers of the appellant state while investigating a case discovered a workshop run by a mechanic who was then actually working on a revolver. Several other guns, revolvers and rifles were found in the workshop and all these fire arms were seized. The mechanic claimed to have received one of the guns so seized from a gun licensee and the rest from respondents 1 to 4 for repairs. The mechanic had no valid licence under the to keep or repair these fire arms but respondent No. 4 however possessed licences under the Act to run the business of repairing and dealing in fire arms. The police charge sheeted the mechanic, the gun licensee and respondents 1 to 4, for having committed offences under Sections 25(1)(a) and 27 of the Act. The Magistrate held that there were materials to make out a prima facie case under section 25(1)(c) of the Act against the gun licensee and under section 29(b) of the Act against the mechanic and charged them accordingly. As regards Respondents 1 to 4 taking the view that giving of the arms to the mechanic by the respondents for the limited purpose of repairs, did not amount to delivery of 'possession ' of those arms within the meaning of section 29(b) of the Act, he discharged the said respondents. The appellant 's criminal revision against the said order, was dismissed, the High Court holding that Respondents 1 to 4 could not be said to have delivered the fire arms into the 'possession ' of the mechanic within the meaning of section 29(b) of the Act, because the respondents possessed valid licences for repairs as well as for sale of fire arms and had given only 'temporary ' custody of those arms to the mechanic for the limited purpose of carrying out the repair job, while the effective control over those arms all the time remained with the respondents. In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant State that the question whether a person is in possession of a fire arm or had transferred and delivered it to another, is largely one of fact; that in the instant case, the mechanic was not a servant or employee of the respondents but was independently running his own business of repairing fire arms; that the fire arms were handed over by the respondents to the mechanic to be repaired at the latter 's residence cum workshop which was not the respondent 's licensed place 324 of business; that the mechanic had no licence for repairing or keeping fire arms and the respondents were either aware of this fact or did not ascertain it before delivering the fire arms to him, that 'possession ' within the purview of section 29(b) means immediate possession and consequently, delivery of even temporary possession and control to an unauthorised person falls within the mischief of the section; that in the circumstances of the instant case there was a clear prima facie case not only under section 29(b) but also under section 30 read with section 5 of the Act, against the Respondents and consequently the Magistrate was not justified in discharging them. On behalf of the Respondents it was contended that the mechanic was only in temporary custody of the fire arms for the limited purpose of repairing them, as an agent of the owners, who being licencees in Form IX entitled to repair and keep these fire arms, throughout remained in their lawful possession and control. The delivery of possession contemplated by section 29(b) is something more than entrusting the arms to an 'agent ' for the limited purpose of repairs. Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: 1. \"Possession\" is a polymorphous term which may have different meanings in different contexts. It is impossible to work out a completely logical and precise definition of \"possession\" uniformly applicable to all situations in the contexts of all statutes. \"Possession\" implies a right and a fact; the right to enjoy annexed to the right of property and the fact of the real intention. It involves power of control and intent to control. [328D E] \"Possession\" is not a purely legal concept but also a matter of fact, and the broad test for determining whether a person is in possession of anything is whether he is in general control of it. [328H 329A] Salmond 's Jurisprudence 11th Edn. p. 52 referred to. In the instant case although the respondents held licences in Form IX for repairing and dealing in fire arms at the place of business, factory or shop which was specified in Column 3 of their licences, they handed over the fire arms to the mechanic who had no such licence to be repaired at the latters own workshop. Since that workshop and the repairing business being run therein, was in the exclusive control and occupation of the mechanic, the inference would be that by handing over the fire arms to the mechanic for repair the respondents had divested themselves for the time being not only of physical possession but also of effective control over those fire arms. The respondents had not done anything to ascertain whether the mechanic was legally authorised to retain those fire arms even for the limited purpose of repairing them. Prima facie the materials before the Magistrate showed that the respondents had delivered the fire arms in question into the possession of the mechanic without previously ascertaining that he was legally authorised to have the same in his possession, and as such, they appeared to have committed an offence under section 29(b) of the Act. [330B C, 330G 331A] 3. By allowing the fire arms to be removed to a place other than the place of business or factory specified in Column 3 of the licences in Form IX, the respondents contravened condition (1)(c) of the licence, amounting to an offence punishable under section 30 of the Act. [331 B C] 325 The materials before the Magistrate, prima facie disclosed the commission of offences under Sections 29(b) and 30 of the Act by Respondents 1 to 4. The Magistrate was thus clearly in error in discharging these respondents. [331D] 4. The ratio of cases decided under the Old (Act 11 of 1878) should not be blindly applied to cases under the Act of 1959 which has in several aspects modified or changed the law relating to the regulation of arms. [331H] 5. Trial of summons case as a warrant case does not amount to an illegality but is a mere irregularity that does not vitiate the trial unless there is a prejudice. [333 B] 6. Case remitted to trial Magistrate with direction to frame charges in respect of offences under Sections 29(b) and 30 of the Act against Respondents 1 to 4 and to proceed further with the trial.

            "Prediction: The State of West Bengal filed a Criminal Revision against the Magistrate's order before the High Court contending that delivery of fire arms by a person holding a licence for repairing and dealing in fire arms for repairs to mechanic who holds no such licence, but does the repair job at his workshop at a place different from the factory or place of business of the licence holder, amounts to \"delivery of those arms into the possession of another person\" within the contemplation of Section 29(b) of the (For short, called the 'Act '), and in the result, he discharged the respondents by an order dated November 17, 1971.

They were held to have shot dead two inmates of a house in which along with others they had gone to commit dacoity. One of the appellants filed an appeal in the High Court against his conviction. The High Court thereafter gave notice to both the appellants to show cause why the sentence of imprisonment passed against each of them should not be enhanced to death. After hearing them the High Court sentenced them both to death. The order was challenged in this Court and it was urged that the High Court should not have interfered with the discretion of the Sessions Judge in the matter of passing the appropriate sentence and that the considerations which apply to I sentence under section 302 I.P.C. would not apply to a case under section 396 I.P.C. HELD : (i) The offence committed by the appellants was heinous and committed in cold blood with the sole object of committing dacoity. It was not a case of constructive liability but the appellants had themselves committed the murders and therefore no advantage could be taken of the fact that the conviction was under section 396 and not under section 302. On the above facts the enhancement of sentence by the High Court from life imprisonment to death was justified especially when the trial court had not given any reasons for awarding the lesser sentence.

            "Target: The appellants three children belong to a sect called Jehovah 's Witnesses who worship only Jehovah the Creator and none other. They refused to sing the National Anthem: 'Jana Gana Mana ' because, according to them, it is against the tenets of their religious faith not the words or the thoughts of the National Anthem but the singing of it. They desisted from actual singing only because of their aforesaid honest belief and conviction but they used to stand up in respectful silence daily, during the morning assembly when the National Anthem was sung. A Commission was appointed to enquire and report, and it reported that the children were \"law abiding\" and that they showed no disrespect to the National Anthem. However, under the instructions of Deputy Inspector of Schools, the Head Mistress expelled the appellants from school from July 26, 1985. A representation by the father of the children to the Education Authorities requesting that the children may be permitted to attend the 519 school pending orders from the Government having failed, the appellants filed a Writ Petition in the High Court seeking an order restraining the authorities from preventing them from attending the school. A single Judge and then a Division Bench rejected the prayer of the appellants. Allowing the appeal by Special Leave, to this Court, ^ HELD: 1.1. The Fundamental Rights of the appellants under article 19(1)(a) and 25(1) have been infringed and they are entitled to be protected. The expulsion of the three children from the school for the reason that because of their conscientiously held religious faith, they do not join the singing of the National Anthem in the morning assembly though they do stand respectfully when the National Anthem is sung, is a violation of the fundamental right to freedom of conscience and freely to profess, practice and propagate religion. Therefore, the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the respondent authorities are directed to re admit the children into the school, to permit them to pursue their studies without hindrance and to facilitate the pursuit of their studies by giving them the necessary facilities. [538D E; 539 C D] 1.2 There is no provision of law which obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem nor is it disrespectful to the National Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung does not join the singing. Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing. Standing up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung but not singing oneself clearly does not either prevent the singing of the National Anthem or cause disturbance to an assembly engaged in such singing so as to constitute the offence mentioned in section 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act. [527B G] 2.1 Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution guarantees to all citizens freedom of speech and expression, but Article 19(2) provides that nothing in Article 19(1)(a) shall prevent a State from making any law, in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the said right. article 25(1) guarantees to all persons freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion, subject to order, morality and health and to the other provisions of Part III of the Constitution. article 51 A(a) of the Constitution enjoins a dub on every citizen of India \"to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem\". [526G H; 527C] 520 2.2 While on the one hand, article 25(1) itself expressly subjects the right guaranteed by it to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of Part III, on the other hand, the State is also given the liberty to make a law to regulate or restrict any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice and to provide for social welfare and reform, even if such regulation, restriction or provision affects the right guaranteed by article 25(1). Therefore, whenever the Fundamental Right to freedom of conscience and to profess, practise and propagate religion is invoked, the act complained of as offending the Fundamental Right must be examined to discover whether such act is to protect public order, morality and health, whether it is to give effect to the other provisions of Part III of the Constitution or whether it is authorised by a law made to regulate or restrict any economic, financial political or secular activity which may be associated with religious practise or to provide for social welfare and reform. [531G H; 532A B] 2.3 Any law which may be made under clauses 2 to 6 of article 19 to regulate the exercise of the right to the freedoms guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) to (e) and (g) must be 'a law ' having statutory force and not a mere executive or departmental instructions. [529E F] The two circulars on which the Department, in the instant case, has placed reliance have no statutory basis and are mere departmental instructions. They cannot, therefore, form the foundation of any action aimed at denying to citizens Fundamental Right under article 19(1)(a). Further it is not possible to hold that the two circulars were issued 'in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relation with foreign states, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence ' and if not so issued, they cannot again be invoked to deny a citizen 's Fundamental Right under article 19(1)(a). If the two circulars are to be so interpreted as to compel each and every pupil to join in the singing of the National Anthem despite his genuine, conscientious religious objection, then such compulsion would clearly contravene the rights guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) and article 25(1). [530C E; 529C] Kharak Singh vs State of U.P., ; and Kameshwar Prasad vs The State of Bihar, [1962] Supp. SCR 369 relied upon. The Kerala Education Act contains no provision of relevance and the appellants in the present case have never been found guilty of 521 misconduct such as that described in Chapter IX, Rule 6 of the Kerala Education Rules. On the other hand, the report of the Commission, is to the effect that the children have always been well behaved, law abiding and respectful. [528 B C] 4. The question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of religion. Personal views and reactions are irrelevant. If the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held it attracts the protection of article 25 but subject, of course, to the inhibitions contained therein. [533F G] In the instant case, what the petitioners truly and conscientiously believe is not in doubt. They do not hold their beliefs idly and their conduct is not the outcome of any perversity. The petitioners have not asserted those beliefs for the first time or out of any unpatriotic sentiment Jehovah 's Witnesses, as they call themselves, appear to have always expressed and stood up for such beliefs all the world over.

The High Court dismissed the petition. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : The rules for winding up on a creditor 's petition are if there is a bona fide dispute about a debt and the defence is a substantial one, the court would not ' order winding up. The defence of the company should be in good faith and one of substance. if the defence is likely to succeed on a point of law and the company adduced prima facie proof of the facts on which the defence depends, no order of winding up would be made by the Court. Further under section 557 of the , in all matters relating to winding up of a company the court may ascertain the wishes of the creditors. If, for some good reason the creditors object to a winding up order, the court, in its discretion, may refuse to pass such an order. Also, the winding up order will not be made on a creditor 's petition if it would not benefit the creditor or the company 's creditors generally. [207 D, G H; 208 C D] (1) In the present case, the claims of the appellants were disputed both in fact and in law. The company had given prima facie evidence that the appellants were not entitled to any claim. The company had also raised the defence of lack of privity and of limitation. [208 D F] (2) One of the claims of the appellants was proved by the company to be unmeritorious and 'false, and as regards the admitted debt the company had stated that there was a settlement between the company and the appellants that the appellants would receive a lesser amount and that the company would pay it off out of the proceeds of sale of the company 's properties. [208 F G] (3) The creditors of the company for the sum of Rs. 7,50,000 supported the company and resisted the appellants ' application for winding up. [209 G] (4) The cumulative evidence in support of the case of the company is that the appellants consented to any approved of the sale of the machinery. As shareholders, they had expressly written that they had no objection to the sale of the machinery and the letter was issued in order to enable the company to hold an extraordinary general meeting on the subject. The company passed a resolution authorising the sale. The 256 Sup. Cl/72 202 appellants themselves were parties to the proposed sale and wanted to buy the machinery. Where the shareholders had approved of the sale it could not be said that the transaction was unauthorised or improvident.[209 A F] (5) In determining whether or not the substratum of the company had gone, the objects of the company and the case of the company on that question would have to be looked into. In the present case, the company alleged that with the proceeds of sale the Company intend to enter into some other profitable business. such as export business which was within its objects. The mere fact that it had suffered trading losses will not destroy its substratum unless there is no reasonable prospect of it ever making a profit in the future. A court would not draw such an inference normally. One of its largest creditors, who opposed the winding up petition would help it in the export business. The company had not abandoned the objects of its business. Their ,fore, on the facts and circumstances of the present case it could not be held that the substratum of the company had gone. Nor could it be held that the company was unable to meet the outstandings of any of its admitted creditors. The company had deposited money in court as per the directions of the Court and had not ceased carrying on its business. [211A G] (6) On the facts of the case it is apparent that the appellants had presented the petition with improper motives and not for any legitimate purpose. The appellants were its directors, had full knowledge of the company 's affairs and never made demands 'for their alleged debts. They sold their shares, went out of management of the company and just when the sale of the machinery was going to be effected presented the petition for winding up.

            "Target: For the assessment years 1961 62 and 1962 63, the corresponding valuation dates of which were March 31, 1961 and March 31, 1962, assessment orders were made under the Wealth Tax Act on March 24, 1961 and March 23, 1962 respectively while the notice of demands were served on the assessee on April 11, 1961 and April 11, 1962 respectively. Against the said notices of demand the assessee preferred appeals on May 9, 1961 and May 9, 1962 respectively. For the purpose of determining the assessee 's net wealth, the assessee 's claim for a deduction of certain sums representing the estimated liabilities on account O? ' income tax and wealth tax was rejected in both assessments by the Wealth Tax Officer. On appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Wealth Tax allowed a part of the claim. In appeal before the Appellate Tribunal, the Revenue contended that since the assessee had disputed the wealth tax liability of Rs. 22,679/ in respect of the assessment year 1960 61 and the sum of Rs. 39,692/ in respect of the assessment year 1961 62, he was not entitled to a deduction of the same, being barred by reason of the provisions of section 2(m) (iii) (a) of the Wealth Tax Act. The Tribunal rejected the said contention and held that section 2 (m)(a) was not attracted as the tax had not become payable on the relevant valuation dates. The Wealth Tax References made at the instance of the Revenue were decided in favor of the assessee by the High Court of Gujarat by its common judgement in Commissioner of Wealth Tax vs Kantilal Manilal reported in The present appeal by special leave arises therefrom. Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.1 In order to invoke the bar prescribed by Section 2(m) (iii) (a) of the Wealth Tax Act it is necessary for the Revenue to establish that both 298 requirements therein are satisfied, that is to say, that an amount of the tax is outstanding on the valuation date and further that the amount is claimed by the assessee in an appeal as not being payable by him. [302E F] 1.2 An amount of tax is outstanding if it is payable and has remained unpaid. In other words, if there is a debt due and there has been no payment of the debt. There are three stages in respect of an income tax liability. The tax liability comes into existence on the last day o f the previous year relevant to the assessment year. Thereafter when the assessment proceedings take place an assessment order is made quantifying the assessable income and determining the tax payable. Thereupon, a notice of demand is served for payment of the tax, and the tax then becomes payable and a debt becomes due to the Revenue. A survey of the provisions of the Wealth Tax Act contained in Sections 14 to 17 and Section 30 makes it clear that in all material respects the scheme of the Wealth Tax Act is in this regard substantially, the same as that incorporated in the Income Tax Act. The notice of demand requiring payment of the tax, interest or penalty is issued pursuant to Section 30 of the Act. If the amount remains unpaid within the periods specified in the notice the amount of the tax is said to be outstanding [303D F] 1.3 Section 2(m)(iii)(a) of the Wealth Tax Act comes into play only after a demand for payment of tax has been made. The clause, read in its entirety, speaks of a debt owed by the assessee represented by an amount of tax \"payable in consequence of any order\" passed under the relevant tax statute and \"outstanding on the valuation dates.\" [303H; 304A] 1.4 The expression \"debt owed\" is a debt which the assessee is under an obligation to pay and, therefore, it includes both a liability to pay in present as well as a liability to pay in future an ascertainable sum of money. Both kinds of liabilities are included within the expression \"debt owed\". But Section 2(m)(iii)(a) narrows the scope down to a liability which exists in present time because the clause speaks of tax outstanding in consequence of an order passed under the relevant taxing statute. [304B C] 1.5 In the present case, the notice of demand in each case was served after the valuation date had been passed. There was no demand already subsisting on the respective valuation dates. As the notices of demand respecting the wealth tax liability of Rs. 22,679 and Rs. 39,692 were served on the assessee subsequent to the valuation dates, if cannot be said that on the respective valuation dates the amount of tax were outstanding. In the result a material requirement of Section 2(m) (iii) (a) is not satisfied and therefore, it cannot be invoked by the Revenue. [304D E] Commissioner of Wealth Tax vs Kantilal Manilal, , approved. Doorga Prasad vs The Secretary of State, , quoted with approval 299 Kesoram Industries & Cotton Mills Ltd. vs Commissioner of Wealth Tax (Central), Calcutta, ; , followed. 1.6 The appeals in the present case, though filed subsequent to the respective valuation dates, would none the less have sufficed to bring the second requirement of section 2 (m) (iii) (a) into operation. But for Section 2 (m) (iii) (a) an amount of a tax outstanding on the valuation date would constitute a debt owed by the assessee on the valuation date, and the assessee would be entitled to claim its deduction in the process of computing his net wealth. Parliament, however, intended that if the amount of the tax was challenged by the assessee as not being payable by him by recourse to any of the statutory remedies prescribed in the relevant Act, such claim to deduction would be barred. Plainly, in order to give full effect to that intent it is immaterial whether the statutory remedy is being availed of on the valuation date or has been taken thereafter. A challenge by the assessee that the amount outstanding is not payable by him is sufficient to bar his claim to deduction whether the challenge is subsisting on the valuation date or is initiated after the valuation date has passed.

The claim was rejected by the Wealth Tax Officer in both assessments. On appeal by the assessee, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Wealth Tax allowed a part of the claim. In the appeal, the Revenue contended inter alia that the provisions of section 2 (m) (iii) (a) were not applicable in respect of liabili 300 ties arising under the wealth tax assessments of the asses.

Clause 4 of the rent note provided that the tenant was to run the 'business of English Liquor Vend, and do sale of liquor in the shop. ' The respondent filed a petition for eviction under section 13 of the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent & Eviction) Act, 1973 against the appellant on the ground of ground of rent from 1st April, 1979 to 31st August, 1979 and change of user from liquor vend business to that of general merchandise. The appellant tendered the entire arrears of rent at the first date of hearing, and contested the eviction petition by filing a written statement contending that after March, 1979 the licence of liquor vend in his favour was not renewed, and he had to discontinue that business at the suit premises, and had to start the business of general merchandise. It was, further, contended that the purpose of user still remained commercial and that there was no clause in the rent note prohibiting the appellant to change to any other business. The Rent Controller held that the appellant had changed the user of the shop in dispute and that he was liable for eviction under the Act. 346 The Appellate Authority dismissed the appeal. The High Court also dismissed the Civil Revision and upheld the order of eviction. Allowing the Appeal, this Court, ^ HELD: 1. The business purposes must be adjudged in the light of the purposes of the Rent Act in question which is to control the eviction of tenants therefrom. [349C] 2. In the expanding concept of business nowadays and the growing concept of departmental stores, it cannot be said that there was any change of user in the instant case, when the tenant converted the use of the building from liquor vend business to that of general merchandise. The building was rented for the purpose of carrying on a business. It was used for another business which would not in any way impair the utility or damage to the building, and the business could be conveniently carried on in the said premises. No nuisance was also created. The case would, therefore, not attract the mischief of section 13(2)(ii)(b). [349D, 350E] 3. So far as the High Court of Punjab and Haryana held in the Full Bench decision in Sikander Lal vs Amrit Lal, (1984 Punjab Law Reporter 1) that allied business would not amount to change of user but for a business which is not allied for the business for which it was let out would amount to change of user come within the mischief of clause (b) of section 13(2)(ii) of the Act, the same must be read with reservation.

            "Target: Clause 3(e) of Para 4 of the Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme of the Government of India entitles a freedom fighter to pension for having become permanently incapaci tated during firing or lathi charge in the freedom struggle. The appellant applied for grant of pension on the ground that he had suffered permanent loss of vision in his left eye due to brutal lathi charge by the police against freedom fighters. His claim of permanent loss of vision in the left eye was duly certified by Government doctors. The District Collector after making a detailed enquiry, certified the claim of the appellant as a bona fide one and recommended his case for grant of pension. The State Government also appended their recommendation. The Ministry of Home Affairs, however, declined to grant pension on the view that loss of vision in one eye did not amount to permanent incapacita tion. A single Judge of the High Court dismissed appellant 's writ petition and a writ appeal against the said order was also dismissed by a Division Bench. In this appeal by special leave, it was contended for the respondents that the incapacitation under clause 3(e) must not only be permanent but it must also be a total one, and since the appellant had not lost vision in both the eyes the incapacitation, though permanent, was only partial and not total; and that the petitioner had not been able to produce any documentary evidence from official records of the relevant period in support of his claim. 721 Allowing the appeal, HELD: 1.1 The words used in clause 3(e) of Para 4 of the Pension Scheme are \"permanently incapacitated\" and not 'permanently totally incapacitated\". The measure of test thus laid down by the clause is the permanent nature of the incapacitation and not the total nature of the incapacita tion. If clause (e) were to be interpreted to include total incapacitation then a freedom fighter who has lost a leg or an arm cannot claim payment of pension on the basis of permanent incapacitation inasmuch as the incapacitation suffered by him is not of both the legs or both the arms. It would be height of injustice to freedom fighters to construe clause (e) in the said manner. 1724F; 725A B] 1.2 In view of the certificate issued to him by the Government doctors that the appellant had suffered permanent incapacitation of his left eye due to lathi blows received by him during the freedom struggle and the State Government authorities having, after due enquiry, accepted the bona fides of the appellant 's claim and recommended his case for grant of pension the respondents were not justified in refusing to grant him pension under clause (e) of the Scheme. [724G, 726C, 725E] 2. No one can really expect official records to have been preserved for a period of 40 years to prove the treat ment given to a freedom fighter for the injuries sustained by him during the freedom struggle. Hence, the objection relating to non production of official records of the reley ant period by the appellant to prove the sustainment of injury by him .deserves outright rejection as well as out right condemnation.

At his request he was transferred to a jail in the State of Punjab, to which State he belonged. He applied to the Government of Punjab that under the Punjab Jail Manual he is entitled to be released since he had completed more than 20 years of imprisonment. The application was sent to the Government of Madhya Pradesh, which rejected it. In a writ petition filed by him the High Court of Punjab and Haryana held that the State of Punjab was the appropriate authority to release him and directed the State of Punjab to consider the matter. In appeal to this Court, the State of Madhya Pradesh contended: (i) that since the sentence was of imprisonment for life, it would not expire automatically at the expiry of ' 20 years including remissions: and (ii) that as the prisoner was convicted by a court in the State of Madhya Pradesh the appropriate Government the exercise discretion under sections 401 and 402 Cr. P.C. was the State of Madhya Pradesh and not the State of Punjab., Allowing the appeal, ^ HELD: The High Court was in error in holding that the respondent was entitled to be released as of right on completing the term of 20 years including remissions. [556] Gopal Vinayak Godse vs State of Maharashtra and Others, ; and Pandit Kishori Lal vs King Emperor, L.R. 72 I.A.1, followed. (1) A sentence of imprisonment for life does not automatically expire at the end of 20 years including remissions because the administrative rules framed under the various Jail Manuals or under the Prisons Act cannot supersede the statutory provisions of the Indian Penal Code. A sentence of imprisonment for life means a sentence for the entire life of the prisoner unless the appropriate Government chooses to exercise its discretion to remit either the whole or a part of the sentence under section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. [559G] (2) The appropriate Government has the discretion to remit or refuse to remit the sentence and where it refuses to remit the sentence no writ can be issued directing the State Government to release the prisoner. [560A] (a) The appropriate Government which is empowered to grant remission under section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is the Government of the State where the prisoner had been convicted and sentenced, that is, the transferor State and not the transferee State where the prisoner may have been transferred at his instance under the Transfer of Prisoners Act. [56B] (b) Where the transferee State feels that the accused had complected a period of 20 years it has merely to forward the request of the prisoner to the Government of the State where the prisoner was convicted and sentenced and if this request was rejected by the State Government the order of the Government cannot be interfered with by a High Court in its writ jurisdiction.

            "Target: The appellant assessee, a body of individuals, purchased two pieces of land in the year 1966. In 1970 it granted a mining lease to a private company (an allied concern) to extract clay for a period of ten years at a premium of Rs. 5 lakhs in addition to payment of royalty. The Income tax Officer construed the lease deed as transferring a lease hold interest in the land in favour of the company and came to the conclusion that the transfer was assessable to capital gains tax. For the purpose of comput ing the extent of tax, the Income tax Officer valued the lease hold interest at 5/8th of the sale price of the entire land, computed the cost at acquisition of the lease hold interest say Rs. 17,040, and after deducting this sum from the sale consideration of Rs.5 lakhs, determined a sum of Rs.4,82,960 as long term capital gains. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of the Income tax Officer the assessee preferred an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the assessment but allowed deduction on the entire price of the land on the ground that the cost for the pur pose of ascertaining the capital gains would be the total price of the land paid by assessee. Not being satisfied, the assessee preferred an appeal to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal which confirmed the order of the Appellate Commissioner and dismissed the appeal. The High Court on a reference held that the right conferred on 597 the lessee under the lease deed was also a capital asset in the hands of the assessee lessor, and that there was a transfer of capital asset for a consideration of Rs.5 lakhs. The High Court accordingly answered the reference against the assessee, .but granted a certificate under section 261 of the Act to appeal to this Court. On behalf of the assessee appellant it was contended: (1) that conceptually there is no 'cost of acquisition ' which is attributable to the right of limited enjoyment transferred by the grant of the lease, and (2) relying on the decision of this Court in C.I. T. vs B.C. Srinivas Sherry, ; SC it was submitted that since the cost of acquisition of the right granted under the lease cannot be determined the computation provisions under the Act cannot apply at all, and as such section 45 of the Act is not attracted. On the question: whether the grant of a mining lease for a period of ten years by the assessee can give rise to a capital gain taxable under section 45 of the Income tax Act, 1961. Dismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1(a) Section 2(14) of the Income Tax Act defines \"capital asset\" as \"property of any kind held by an asses see. \" What is parted with in the instant case, under the terms of the deed is the right to exploit the land by ex tracting clay which right directly flows from the ownership of the land. The said right evaluated in terms of money forms part of the cost of acquiring the land. [601C D] 1(b). If a transfer of a capital asset in section 45 of the Act includes grant of a mining lease for any period, then obviously, the \"cost of acquisition\" of the land would include the \"cost of acquisition\" of the mining right under the lease. The grant of a lease being a transfer of an asset, there is no escape from the conclusion that there is a live nexus between the \"cost of acquisition\" of the land and the right granted under the lease. [601G H; 602A] In the instant case, the amount of Rs.27,260 paid by the assessee was not only the cost of acquiring the land but also acquiring a bundle of rights in the said land including the right to grant lease. [602A] 1(c) The apportionment of the cost of acquisition is a question of fact to be determined by the Income tax Officer in each case on the basis of evidence. The determination of the cost of the right to excavate 598 clay in the land in terms of money may be difficult but is nonetheless of a money value and the best valuation possible must be made. In the instant came, the Income tax Officer worked out the cost of the lease held interest by adopting the 5/8th ratio, though the Appellate Assistant Commissioner gave the benefit to the assessee of the full price of the land paid by him. [602B D] 1(d) Once the cost of lease hold right is determined than there is no difficulty in making apportionment. [602E] Gold Coast Selection Trust.

            "Target: The Appellant was working as a Cashier in a Bank. A depositor who had a Savings Bank Account with the Bank came to the Bank to receive his Pass Book. On receipt of his Pass Book from the Counter Clerk he complained to the ledger keeper that, on a certain date he had withdrawn only Rs. 500 but a debit entry of Rs, 1,500 had been shown in the Pass Book. The Ledger keeper took the depositor to the Supervisor and The Agent and his complaint was recorded. When the documents pertaining to the withdrawal were examined it was found that the depositor had given a letter of authority to the appellant authorising withdrawal from his account. The letter of authority showed that it was for withdrawal of Rs. 1500 though there appeared to be some interpolation suggesting that the figure of Rs. 500 had been altered lo the figure of Rs. 1500. A memorandum of charge was served on the appellant by the Management respondent No. I and a disciplinary enquiry was held. The Enquiry Officer submitted his report and his findings were that the appellant had fraudulently altered the amount in the letter of authority given by the depositor, withdrew Rs. 1500 from the depositor 's account and paid Rs. 500 only to the depositor and 228 misappropriated Rs. 1500. In pursuance of the enquiry the appellant was discharged from service. The appellant having raised an industrial dispute the matter was referred to the Industrial Tribunal. Before the Tribunal the appellant denied the charges and pleaded that as the depositor was not examined in the disciplinary enquiry there was no legal evidence before the Enquiry officer for finding that he was guilty. Before the Tribunal the Management examined no witnesses but produced documents and relied on them. The Tribunal held that on the evidence before it the appellant could not be held guilty as in the absence of the evidence of the depositor, the evidence recorded was 'hearsay ' and directed reinstatement to the appellant with full back wages. The respondent moved the High Court under Article 226 and 227 which held that the charge against the appellant had been established and quashed the award of the Tribunal. In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant: (1) that the Tribunal exercised its powers under Section 11 A of the and the High Court exercising powers under Article 226/227 had no jurisdiction to interfere with the award; (2) the Tribunal rightly refused to rely on the evidence which was hearsay; the depositor not having been examined, and (3) the High Court committed an error in not considering the receipt executed by the depositor showing payment of Rs. 1000 to the depositor. Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: The award of the Tribunal is vitiated by misconception of the law involved. It erred in holding that as Kansal (depositor) was not examined, fraud and misappropriation on the part of appellant cannot be held to be proved and in failing to appreciate the confession made by the appellant to the higher officer that he had altered the amount in figures and words in his own hand. [236 G] 1. In an application for a writ of certiorari under Article 226 for quashing the award of an Industrial Tribunal the jurisdiction of the High Court is limited. It can quash the award when the Tribunal has committed an error of law apparent on the face of the record or when the finding of facts of the Tribunal is perverse. [233 B] In the instant case, three kinds of proceedings against the delinquent were possible: (i) departmental proceedings and action, (ii) Criminal prosecution for the alleged misappropriation of the amount, and (iii) civil proceedings for recovery of the amount alleged to be misappropriated. The respondent adopted the first course and instituted the domestic enquiry. In such an enquiry guilt need not be established beyond reasonable doubt; proof of misconduct may be sufficient. [234 G 235 A] State of Haryana & Anr. vs Rattan Singh , referred to 229 2. The word 'hearsay ' is used in various senses. Sometimes it means whatever a person declares on information given by someone else. [235 E] In the instant case, the Tribunal after having made a detailed reference to the evidence of the witnesses found that a complaint was made by Kansal and that the appellant confessed that he had altered the debit authority, but held That as Kansal was not examined, this was not direct evidence but was of the nature of 'hearsay ' evidence, with regard to the fact whether the appellant manipulated the documents, withdrew the excess amount and misappropriated it, there is no direct evidence of any of the witnesses except the appellant 's confession. The evidence on which reliance has been taken by the respondent is the confession and circumstantial evidence. The evidence of Kansal would have been primary and material. if the fact in issue were whether Kansal authorised the appellant to make the alterations in the authority letter. But Kansal 's complaint was to the contrary. No rule of law enjoins that a complaint has to be in writing as insisted by the Tribunal. For the purpose of a departmental enquiry, complaint substantiated by circumstantial evidence is enough. What the respondent sought to establish in the domestic enquiry was that Kansal had made a verbal complaint with regard to the withdrawal of excess money by the appellant. On the factum of complaint of Kansal the evidence of these four witnessess is direct as the complaint is said to have been made by Kansal in their presence and hearing. It is not therefore 'hearsay '. The respondent has succeeded in proving that a complaint was made by Kansal on the evidence of these four witnesses.

The conditions of detention under sub rule 4 of r. 30 of the said rules were prescribed to be the same as those under the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order, 1951. While so detained the first respondent wrote a book of scientific interest and sought permission from The State Government to send it out of jail for publication. The request having been rejected he filed a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution praying for a direction to the State Government to permit him to send out the manuscript for Publication.

It was contended on behalf of the, appellant that the first respondent not being a free person could exercise only such privileges a, , were conferred on him by the order of detention, and the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order, 1951 which regulated the terms of the respondent 's detention did not confer on him any privilege or right to write a book and send it out of the prison for publication. HELD : (i) It cannot be said that the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order, 1951 which lays down the conditions regulating the restrictions on the liberty of a detenu, conferred only certain privileges on the detenu. If this argument were to be accepted it would mean that the detenu could be starved to death, if there was no condition providing for giving food to the detenu. In the matter of liberty of a subject such a construction shall not be given to the said rules and regulations unless for compelling reasons. [7O8 C D] (ii) The said conditions regulating the restriction on the personal liberty of a detenu are not privileges conferred on him, but are the conditions subject to which his liberty can be restricted. As there is no condition in the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order, 1951, prohibiting a detenu from writing a book or sending it for publication, the State of Maharashtra in refusing to allow the same infringed the personal liberty of the first Respondent in derogation of the law whereunder he was detained. [708 E] (iii) The effect of the President 's order under article 359 of the Constitution was that the right to move the High Court or the Supreme Court remained suspended during the period of emergency if a person was deprived of his personal liberty under the Defence of India Act, 1962, or any rule or order made thereunder. If a person was deprived of his personal liberty not under the Act or rule or order made thereunder but in contravention thereof his right to move the said courts in that regard would not be suspended. [705 C D] 703 Since the State Government 's refusal to allow publication of the first respondent 's book was in contravention and derogation of the 'law under which he was detained he had the right to move the High Court under article 226 and the said High Court was empowered to issue an appropriate writ or direction to the said Government to act in accordance with law. \n",

Shortly, there. after, the village waseanoified and the estate of the owners was resumed by the appellant. The respondent contended that 174 the appellant was bound to renew the leases. The appellant contended that the shrotriemdars had no right in the minerals, that they could not have granted any leases for mining the minerals and that as such no question of renewing the leases arose. Held, that shrotriemadras had no rights in the minerals and the leases granted by them to the respondent had no legal effect, The mere fact that a person was the holder of an inam grant was not by itself enough to establish that the inam grant included the grant of sub soil rights in addition to surface rights. The grant of sub soil rights depended upon the language used in the grant ; if there were no words in the grant from which grant of sub soil rights could be properly inferred it would only convey surface rights to the grantee. The original grant in the present case was not available and the inam fair register did not show that the grant included the grant of sub soil rights. No inference could he drawn of the grant of sub soil rights from the fact that the inam grant included poramboke (unculturable land) also. The difficulty that may arise in the working of the mines on account of the mines vesting in the state and the surface rights vesting in the shrotriemdars could not make the shrotriemdars co sharers in the sub soil rights so as to entitle them to grant leases of the subsoil rights.

The knife penetrated the heart of G and he died. B and the appellant were 647 tried for the murder of G; B was acquitted and the appellant was convicted under section 304 Part II Indian Penal Code and sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment. The appellant contended that he had acted in the right of private defence of person under section 100 fifthly Indian Penal Code, which extended to the causing of death as G had assaulted his wife with the intention of abducting her. The respondent urged that section 100 fifthly applied only when the abduction was of such a nature as was punishable under the Penal Code. Held, that the appellant had the right of private defence of the body of his sister which extended to the causing of death of G. The extended right under section 100 arose when there was the offence of assault of one of the types mentioned in the six clauses of that section. It was not necessary that the intention with which the assault was committed must always bean offence itself. The word \" abduction \" used. in the fifth clause of section 100 meant nothing more than what was defined as \" abduction \" in section 362, and it was not necessary, to get the protection of this clause, that the abduction must be of a type punishable under the Penal Code.

The appellant sued for the ejectment of the respondent on the grounds that (i) he required the premises for his own residence and that (ii) the respondent had built a suitable residence for himself in another locality. The first plea was based on the ground mentioned in section 133(1)(e) and the second plea on section 13(1)(h) of the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act, 1952. The trial court decreed the suit but the appellate court and the High Court dismissed it on the finding that from the beginning of the tenancy a substantial part of the premises was used by the respondent for his professional work obviously with the consent of the appellant. Held, that premises let for residential purposes but used by 679 the tenant with the consent of the landlord incidentally for commercial, professional or other purposes cease to be premises let for a residential purpose alone and as such the landlord would not be entitled to eject the tenant under section 13(1)(e) of the Act.

He permitted the respondents to remain in possession but got a rent note executed by Respondent No.3, the first cousin of Respondent No.1. After the expiry of 5 years when the house was not repurchased by the respondents, the appellant 's father (plaintiff) instituted a suit for arrears of rent and ejectment against Respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 (Defendant Nos. 2, 3 and 1) claiming that defendant No. 1 was in arrears of rent and defendant Nos. 2 and 3 were his sub tenants. The Trial Court decreed the suit for ar rears of rent against defendant No. 1 but dismissed the suit for ejectment against defendant Nos. 2 and 3 holding that they were not sub tenants. Defendant No. 1 filed an appeal against the decree for arrears of rent. The Appellate Court dismissed the appeal with an observation that though the rent note was executed by Defendant No. 1, the possession of Defendant Nos. 2 and 3 was on behalf of Defendant No. 1 since they were closely related. Relying on these observa tions the plaintiff filed a second suit against the defend ants with a change that defendant Nos. 2 and 3 were licen sees of defendant No.1.

Both defendant No. 1 sepa rately and defendant Nos. 2 and 3 jointly filed two appeals which were dismissed.

            "Target: The separate income and means of the wife can be taken into account in determining the amount of maintenance payable to her under section 488, Criminal Procedure Code, 1898. [490 D] (1)(a) The section does not confer an absolute right on a neglected wife to get an order of maintenance against the husband nor does it impose an absolute liability on the husband to support her in all circumstances. The use of the word ,may ' in section 488(1) indicates that the power conferred on the Magistrate is discretionary, though the discretion must be exercised in a judicial manner consistently with the language of the statute and with due regard to other relevant circumstances of the case. [486 B I] (b)The object of Ss. 488 to 490 being to prevent vagrancy and destitution, the Magistrate has to find out what is required by the wife to maintain a standard of living which is neither luxurious nor penurious, but is consistent with the status of the family. Such needs and requirements of the wife can be fairly determined only if her separate income, also, is taken into account together with the earnings of the husband and Ms commitments. [488 D E] (c)The mere fact that the language of section 488(1) does not expressly make the inability of a wife to maintain herself a condition precedent to the maintainability does not imply that while determining her claim and fixing the amount of maintenance, the Magistrate is debarred from taking into consideration the wife 's own separate income or means of support. There is a clear distinction between a wife 's locus standi to file a petition under the section and her being (entitled to a particular amount of maintenance. Even in the case of a neglected child the proof of the preliminary condition, namely, the inability to maintain itself, will only establish the child 's competence to file the petition; but its entitlement to maintenance and the fixation of the amount would depend upon the discretion of the Magistrate. [485 B D] (d)There is nothing in the sections to show that in determining the maintenance the Magistrate should take into account only the means of the husband and not the means of the wife. On the contrary, section 489(1) provides that 'on proof of a change in the circumstances of any person receiving under section 488 a monthly allowance, the Magistrate may make such alteration in the allowance as he thinks fit; ' and 'circumstances ' must include financial circumstances.

There is no inconsistency between the 1956 Act 16 M 255 Sup CI/75 484 and section 488, Cr. P.C.

            "Target: In the State of Tamil Nadu the administration was carried on at the village level by a chain of officers in regular gradation one above the other since the commencement of the Christian era. This system known as the barabaluti system consisted of twelve functionaries :(1) headman, (2) karnam or accountant, (3) shroff or notazar, (4) nirganti, (5) toty or taliary, (6) potter, (7) smith, (8) jeweller. (9) carpenter, (10) barber, (11) washerman and (12) astrologer. The first five rendered service to the Government. By the end of the nineteenth century, two Acts were enacted for the purpose of regulating the work of these village offices. The Madras Proprietary States ' Village Service Act, 1894 (Madras Act No. 11 of 1894) dealt with three classes of village officers viz. village accountants, village headman and village watchman. It provided for their appointment, remuneration and summary punishment of misconduct or neglect of duty. The Madras Hereditary Village offices Act 1895 (Madras Act No. 111 of 1895) regulated the succession to certain other hereditary village offices and provided for the appointment of persons to hold such offices and the control of the holders thereof. Under both these statutes, the village offices devolved on a single heir according to the general custom and rule of primogeniture governing succession to impartible zamidaris. In cases to which the aforesaid two statutes were inapplicable provision was made by the Standing orders promulgated by the Board of Revenue, which were known as the Board 's Standing orders for appointing village officers on a hereditary basis. 629 The distinctive features of the service conditions of the village officers appointed under the aforesaid two Acts or the Board 's Standing orders were that they were part time employees of the Government, they were appointed directly by the Revenue officer, the records maintained by them could be retained in their houses, no fixed hours of duty were prescribed, they were not constituted into any distinct service, could not be transferred outside their district, and that they were paid honorarium for the services that they discharged. The Fundamental Rules applicable to all other State Government employees, the Pension Rules, and the Leave Rules were not applicable to these village officers. This Court in Gazula Dasaratha Rama Rao vs The State of Andhra Pradesh & ors. ; having held that section 6 (1) of the Madras Act No. 3 of 1895 was void as it contravened Article 16 (2) of the Constitution, instructions were issued by the Board of Revenue on March 12, 1962 that in respect of future vacancies in village offices governed by the Madras Act No. 2 of 1894, and the Madras Act No. 3 of 1895, the appointments should be made on a temporary basis, and the State Legislature enacted the Madras Proprietary Estates ' Village Service and the Madras Hereditary Village offices (Repeal) Act, 1968 repealing the 1894 and 1895 Acts. Pursuant to section 3 of this Act, the State Government promulgated that Tamil Nadu Village officers Service Rules, 1970 which provided for the constitution of the Tamil Nadu Village officers Service, consisting of (i) Village headman, additional village headman, (ii) village karnam, additional village karnam, and (iii) talayari and nirganti and the method of recruitment to the said posts. In the year 1973, the Administrative Reforms Commission set up by the State Government recommended that the existing part time village officers should be replaced by regular whole time transferable public servants who should form part of the Revenue hierarchy. The State Government accepted this recommendation and promulgated on May 17, 1975 the Tamil Nadu Village officers (appointed under B.S. Os) Service Rules 1974. Thereafter on October 9, 1978 the Tamil Nadu Village officers (appointed under B.S.Os) Service Rules 1978 were issued fixing the age of retirement of village officers at 60 years. On November 13, 1980, the Tamil Nadu Abolition of posts of part time Village officers ordinance, 1980 was promulgated abolishing the posts of part time village officers in the State. The ordinance was later replaced by the Tamil Nadu abolition of posts of part time Village officers Act 1981, which provided for the appointment of Village Administrative officers. By section 3 of the Act, the posts of part time village officers were abolished with elect from November 14, 1980 and every officer holding a post so abolished ceased to hold such post, and section S provided for payment of compensation to those who ceased to be part time village officers. The petitioners in their writ petition to this Court contended that the ordinance and the Act were violative of Article 19 (1) (g); Article 311 (2), and contravened Article 14 of the Constitution. The State Government contested the petitions and contended that the State Government being of the opinion that the 630 system of part time Village officers was out moded and did not fit in with the modern needs of village administration, after careful consideration taken the policy decision to abolish all the posts of part time village officers on grounds of administrative necessity and to introduce a system of whole time officers to be incharge of the village administration. To achieve this, the ordinance was promulgated on November 14, 1980 which was later replaced by the Act. It was further contended, that since by the ordinance and the Act, certain posts had been abolished, the petitioners who were incumbents of the abolished posts could not raise any of the grounds raised by them. Dismissing the petitions, ^ HELD: 1. (i) The power to abolish a civil post is inherent in the right to create it. The Government has always the power, subject to the constitutional provisions to reorganise a department to provide efficiency and to bring about economy. It can abolish an office or post in good faith. The action to abolish a post should not be just a pretence taken to get rid of an inconvenient incumbent. [643 G] American Jurisprudence 2d vol.63 p. 648 649: H. Eliot Kaplan The Law of Civil Service pp 214 215 referred to. In the instant case the abolition of the posts of village officers was sought to be achieved by a piece of legislation passed by the State Legislature, namely the Tamil Nadu Abolition of posts of part time Village officers Act, 1981. Want of good faith or malafides cannot be attributed to the Legislature. [646 A] (ii) The Act is not violative or Article 19 (1) (g) as it does not affect the right of any of the incumbents of the posts to carry on any occupation of their choice even though they may not be able to stick on to the posts which they were holding. [647 C] Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd) Sindri & ors. vs Union of India & ors. ; , referred to. (i) The doctrine of pleasure incorporated in Article 310 cannot be controlled by any legislation; but the exercise of that power by the President or the Governor, is however made subject to the other provisions of the Constitution, one of them being Article 311, which is not made subject to any other provision of the Constitution and is paramount in the field occupied by it. [648 D E] (ii) The termination of service of a Government servant consequent upon the abolition of posts does not involve punishment at all and therefore does not attract Article 311(2). [654 B; 654 E] Parashotam Lal Dhingra vs Union of India ; at 841, Moti Ram Deka etc. vs General Manager, N.E.F., Railways, Maligaon, Pandu etc. 631 ; and P.V. Naik 8. vs state of Maharashtra & Anr., AIR 1967 Bom. 482, referred to. (iii) If a post is not a special post and its incumbent is a member of a cadre his rights as a member of the cadre should be considered before deciding whether he has ceased to be a government employee on the abolition of the post. On such scrutiny it is likely that the services of another member of the cadre may have to be terminated or some other member of the cadre may have to be reverted to a lower post from which he may have been promoted to the cadre in question by the application of the principle of 'last come, first go '. If, however, where the post abolished is a special post or where an entire cadre is abolished and there is no lower cadre to which the members of the abolished cadre can reasonably be reverted, the application of this principle may not arise at all. [653 C D] State of Mysore vs H. Papanna Gowda & Anr. ; , referred to. (iv) In modern administration, it is necessary to recognise the existence of the power with the Legislature or the Executive to create or abolish posts in the civil services of the State. The volume of administrative work, the measures of economy and the need for streamlining the administration to make it more efficient may induce the State Government to make alterations in the staffing patterns of the civil service necessitating either the increase or the decrease in the number of posts. This power is inherent in the very concept of governmental administration. To deny that power to the Government is to strike at the very roots of proper public administration. This power to abolish a post which may result in the holder thereof ceasing to be a Government servant has got to be recognised, but any action legislative or executive taken pursuant to that power is always subject to judicial review.

Abdul Khalik Renzu & Ors. vs The State of Jammu and Kashmir A.I.R. 1965 J & K 15, overruled. In the instant case it cannot be said that the State Act by which the village officers in the State of Tamil Nadu were abolished, contravenes Article 311 (2). [657 F] (v) The posts of village officers which were governed by the Madras Act II of 1894, the Madras Act III of 1895 and the Board s Standing orders were feudalistic in character and the appointment to these posts were governed by the law of primogeniture, the family in which the applicant was born, the village in which he was born, and the fact whether he owned any property in the village or not. These factors are alien to modern administrative service and clearly 632 opposed to Articles 14 and 16. The Administrative Reforms Commission rightly recommended their abolition and reorganisation of the village service. [657 H; 658 A C] (vi) Having regard to the abolition of similar village offices in the neighbouring States of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and the agitation in the State of Tamil Nadu for reorganisation of village service, the decision to abolish the village offices which were feudalistic in character and an anachronism in the modern age cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable.

(i) Any classification under Article 14 should satisfy two tests: (i) that there exists an intelligible differentia between those who are grouped together and those who are not included in the group, and (ii) that there exists a reasonable nexus between the differentia and the object for which classification is made. [662 F] (ii) Upto December 16, 1970 all appointments to Village officers were being made under the two Madras Acts and the Board 's Standing orders on the basis of factors dealt with therein, but after December 16, 1970 recruitment was made in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Village officers Service Rules 1970. By these rules a new service of part time Village officers was constituted and the;, persons who were appointed were paid a fixed amount every month by way of remuneration. Under the Act Of 1981 and the Rules framed thereunder the Village Administrative officers were to be appointed and to be recruited directly. The posts were no longer treated as part time posts and holders thereof were full time government officials entitled to draw salary every month. Even though the Village officers appointed after December 16, 1970 were in a way different from the village officials appointed prior to that date the two cannot be equated with the new Village officers who were to be appointed under the 1981 Act and the rules made thereunder. It cannot therefore be stated that Article 14 of the Constitution has been violated in abolishing the posts held by those appointed after December 16, 1970. [662 H; 663 A E; 663 H; 664A] 4 (i) The State Government will give effect to the memorandum filed on its behalf in the case of those who possess the minimum general qualification prescribed under the Act and the Rules. The State Government shall re employ all such persons who have not crossed the age of superannuation and who are selected in the new cadre. Until they are so selected they will not be paid any remuneration. Even if they are re employed the amount paid to them pursuant to the interim orders will not be recovered. [668 G H; 669 A] (ii) The compensation, if any payable by the State Government under section s of the Act to those who cease to be village officers shall be adjusted against the amount paid pursuant to the interim orders, and any amount in excess of the compensation, shall not be recoverable.

            "Target: FACTS this appeal is by special leave against the judgment of the high court of punjab and haryana confirming the conviction of the accused. the facts of the case in brief are that in view of the chinese invasion air field at sirsa required to be extended for which purpose the ministry of defence, govt. of india took steps to acquire some lands of agriculturists pursuant to which a notification dated november 27, 1962 was issued under section 4 of the land acquisition act 1894 for acquiring 51.79 acres of land situated in the state of ahmedpur. on the next day another notification was issued under section 6 of the land acquisition act on november 28, 1962 and in view of the emergency action under section 17 was taken for obtaining possession of the land with a view to its development. the lands which were acquired belonged to several land holders including moti ram and p.w. 12 kewal chand. the collector gave his award on 26-2-63 in respect of these lands, which actually measured 49.47 acres, at rs. 1350 per acre amounting to rs. 66,784.50 np. apart from this amount compensation was also awarded for standing crop amounting to rs. 11,073.13 np. the case of the prosecution initially was that after the land so acquired with the standing crop was taken possession of by the appellant. he sold the crop to moti ram and kewal chand for rs. 2500 and facilitated the cutting and taking away of the crop by postponing the handing over of the possession to the contractor. a chargesheet was filed against the appellant under section 5 (1) (c) and 5 (1) (d) read with 5 (2) of the prevention of corruption act on 5-8-1966 after obtaining sanction from the govt. of india, ministry of home affairs.  ARGUMENT the learned advocate for the appellant has meticulously taken us through the entire documentary and oral evidence and commented at length upon the various contradictions and incongruities in the case of the prosecution with a view to establishing that when the appellant took possession of the land there was no crop standing on it-that tile possession of the land 'was in fact delivered to telu ram, contractor on 10-1-1963; that the said contractor had admitted 'that possession of the entire land was received by him; that he carried on the construction work in extending the aerodrome; that 200/250 donkeys were also used for doing the work by reason of which the crop was damaged before tehsildar had put the appellant in possession of the land and as a matter of fact there was no crop thereon when he got the possession of the land. it was also contended that the high court had not considered the contradictions in the earlier statement made by some of the witnesses to the military authorities and that it relied on many of the documents for affirming the conviction of the appellant without their actually being put to, him under section 342. it is further contended that the stand taken by the prosecution was that 'the persons who we're permitted to cut the crops bad' not committed any offence.  ISSUE whether the facts were sufficient to sustain the sanction under 5(1)(c) even if the charge under 5(1)(d) had failed. this question in turnwill depend upon what are the ingredients of the offences under 5(1)(c) and (d) read with section 5(2). there was utter confusion in respect of the date on which possession of the acquired land was given to the appellant and the date on which it was given to the contractor for carrying on the work, as also in respect of the fact whether there was any crop standing when the appellant took possession of the land and at what period of time the crop was cut and the work commenced.  ANALYSIS though it is desirable that the facts should be referred to in the sanction itself, nonetheless if they do not appear on the face of it, the prosecution must establish aliunde by evidence that those facts were placed before the sanctioning authorities. it is therefore necessary to first examine the order of sanction to ascertain on what facts it has been accorded. it is apparent that the facts which the central govt. considered for the purposes of according sanction were (a) that the appellant as a public servant was entrusted with crops situated on the land acquired for the extension of air field, sirsa ; (b) that by abusing his position as a public servant he allowed the standing crops to be cut from the said land. c. that by corrupt or illegal means and by abusing his position as a public servant he obtained pecuniary advantage of rs. 2500 as the value of the crops to be cut from the land and/or he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriated that sum by converting it into his own use instead of depositing the said sale price in the govt. treasury. it would be seen therefore that under section 5(1)(c) a public servant will be said to commit the offence of misconduct in hi&; duties if he dishonestly allows any other persons to convert to his own use property which is entrusted to the said public servant the facts which have been set out in the order granting the sanction certainly are sufficient to indicate that the authorities granting the sanction had the offence under section 5(1)(c) also in their contemplation. no work had in fact been undertaken on the land acquired and also that possession of the existing runway and track had already been given. nothing is specifically mentioned about possession of the acquired land being given to him on that date. re no basis for sanction for a charge under section 5(1)(c. a person could not be charged merely with the breach of a particular provision of the order; he must be charged with the commission of certain acts which constitute a breach, and it is to that prosecution that is for having done acts which constitution breach of the order-that the sanction 'is required. in the present case -there is nothing on the face ,of the sanction, and no extraneous evidence, to show that the sanctioning authority knew the facts alleged to constitute a breach of the order, and the sanction is invalid. the case of jaswant singh v. the state of puniab. 1957 indlaw sc 59 was also cited by the respondent's advocate in support of the contention that the trial of two offences requiring sanction was not valid.  STATUTE the facts disclose the commission of the offence of criminal misconduct as defined in section 5(1)(d) read with section 5(2) of the prevention of corruption act 1947 by major som nath accused. under 5(1)(c)-a public servant is said to commit the offence of misconduct in the discharge of his duty if he dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates or otherwise converts for' his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allows any other person so to do, and under (d) if he by corrupt or illegal means or by otherwise abusing his position as a public servant, obtains for himself or for any other person any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage.  \n",

            "Target: The predecessors in interest of the appellants were landlords owning an estate including agricultural land, trees, groves etc., in U.P., and were heavily indebted to the respondents. Most of the debts were secured. On the application of the landlords proceedings were taken under the U.P. Encumbered Estates Act, 1934, and a decree was passed under section 14(7) of the Act in favour of the respondents in 1938. The nature and extent of property liable to attachment and sale, as required by section 19(2)(b) of the Act, were furnished to the executing authority. By virtue of a notification under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. 1950, the estate vested in the State, and new rights, namely, bhumidhari rights in the lands in the estate, were created in 1952 in favour of the appellants who were the successors in interest of the landlords. In 1959. the respondents applied under section 24 of the Encumbered Estates Act to recover the amount decreed to them, by proceeding against the bhumidhari rights and trees belonging to the appellants. On the question whether: (1 ) the bhumidhari rights, and (2) the trees, could be proceeded against, HELD: (1) Though the respondents were mortgagees their rights as such were extinguished under the Encumbered Estates Act and the decree in theft favour under the Act was only a simple money decree which was not executable except under the provisions of the Act. Under section 24 execution can be levied from any property or rights, other than proprietary rights in land, which are reported under section 19 as liable to be attached and sold. On the passing of the U.P. Abolition Act the proprietary rights of the landlords in the land vested in the State and thereafter, the appellants had no proprietary rights left in them. The bhumidhari rights being new rights created for the first time in favour of the appellants under the Abolition Act, are not proprietary rights. In the present case, the requirements of sections 19 and 24 have been complied with, even though the bhumidhari rights were not mentioned as being liable to attachment and sale because. , (i) under section 19(2)(b) the requirement is only to report the nature and extent of the property liable to attachment and sale and not the interests or rights of the debtor in the property; and (ii) the decree under the Encumbered Estates Act was passed in 1938 while the bhumidhari rights were created only in 1952, and hence, could not be specifically mentioned in the decree. When the Encumbered Estates Act permits the respondents to levy execution against the property of the debtor other than the proprietary rights in land, and when there is no prohibition in the Abolition Act against execution of a, decree obtained under the Encumbered Estates Act, against the bhumidhari rights, the respondents were entitled to proceed against such rights.

            "Target: Section 6 of Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 provides a single point tax @ 4 % on declared goods, mentioned in the Third Schedule to that Act. Item (2) of the Third Schedule describes the articles made of Iron & steel which fall in the category of 'declared goods '; sub item (i) of Item (2) pertains to \"pig iron and cast iron including ingot moulds, bottom plates, iron scrap, cast iron scrap, runner scrap and iron skill scrap\". 'Cast iron ' is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as \"a hard alloy of iron, carbon and silicon cast in a mould\". On February 28,1977 the Department of Revenue & Banking (Revenue Wing) Government of India issued a letter to all Finance/ Revenue Secretaries of all State Governments and Union Territories, explaining the term 'Cast Iron ' mentioned in section 14 (iv) (i) of the . This letter said to have been issued in consultation with the Directorate General of Technical Development,_Chief Chemist and the Ministry of Law, Justice & Company Affairs, extended the scope of the expression 'cast iron ' to \"cover 'cast iron casting ' also\". Based on similar clarifications, the Department of Revenue (S) Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh issued a clarificatory order under section 42(2) of the Act vide GOMs No. 383 dated April 17,1985 extending the scope of the expression 'cast iron ' to include \"cast iron castings\". This order was also published in the State 's official Gazette. Section 42 (2) of A.P. General Sales Tax Act empowers the State Government to make, by an order, such provisions as appear to them necessary & expedient to remove difficulty in the implementation of this Act, provided that these are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. The appellant manufactures and sells products like cast iron pipes,man 434 hole covers, etc. He claims that read with the above clarificatory orders, he is liable to pay only 4% sales Tax under Section 6 of the A.P. General Sales Tax ct But, for the assessment year 1989 90 the Commercial Tax Officer C.T.O.) Narayanaguda Circle, Hyderabad levied Sales Tax on the said products at the rate applicable to general goods. The C.T.O. having overruled the appellant 's contentions, the. latter appealed to the Appellate Deputy Commissioner. During the pendency of appeal a notice was issued to the appellant calling upon him to pay the tax assessed, since no stay has been granted in appeal. Against this notice the appellant filed a writ petition No. 9315 of 1992 in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. The Division Bench of the High Court rejected the appellant 's main contention that his products were covered by Item (2) (i)of the Third Schedule to the A.P. General Sales Tax Act, and dismissed the writ petition. Vide Civil Appeal No. 4474 of 1992 (with Writ Petition(Civil) No. 763 of 1992). The appellant questions before this Court the above view of the High Court. Rejecting the appellant 's contentions and upholding the judgment and order of the High Court, this Court, HELD: Law is what is declared by this Court and the High Court.

            "Target: A group of persons residing in a village and professing the Sikh religion made an application to the State Government to declare the religious and charitable institution described in the application as a Sikh Gurdwara. This application was published in the Officer Gazette and respondent No. 1 filed objections under section 8 of the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 contending that the institution was not a Sikh Gurdwara and that he was entitled to raise the said contention because he was the holder of the hereditary office of mahant of the institution. The application was forwarded by the State Government under section 14 to the Sikh Gurdwara Tribunal which held that the respondent was the hereditary holder of the office of mahant of the institution and that the institution was a Sikh Gurdwara and was governed by the Act. The respondent thereupon filed an appeal in the High Court which held that the institution was set up by a mahant for commemorating the memory of his Guru and that the land on which the institution was set up with the grant of Muafi had been donated by a Muslim ruler. After considering of the entries in the land records, the High Court further held that institution was not only serving as a Gurdwara for the worship of Granth Saheb but was also used as a Dera or lodging house or Sadhus or Faqirs of the Udasi Sect and that there was a duality of faiths in the institution. The High Court concluded that the institution was catering to the religious views and beliefs of both the sects amongst the local population and that the Tribunal was in error in declaring that the institution was a Sikh Gudrwara which would permit one of the communities to appropriate the institution to its exclusive use and to deprive the other community or sect from the dual use to which the institution has been put ever since it was founded or established. The High Court, consequently allowed the appeal and set aside the declaration made by the Tribunal. Dismissing the further appeals to this Court 373 ^ HELD: 1. The appraisal of the evidence by the High Court is correct and unexceptional. The evidence discloses that the institution in question was not shown to have been established for use by Sikhs for the purpose of public worship and therefore one of the material conditions for attracting section 16(2)(iii) of the Sikh Gurdwara Act, 1925 was not established. It is immaterial that at the time of presentation of the petition it was along with the followers of Udasi Sect used for worship of Granth Sahib by the Sikhs. [382E F] 2. In order to bring a case under section 16(2)(iii) of the Act it must not only be established that the institution was established by Sikhs for the purpose of public worship but was used for such worship by Sikhs before and at the time of the presentation of the petition. The use of the conjunctive 'and ' clearly imports that in order to attract Section 16(2)(iii) both the conditions must be cumulatively satisfied. [380A B] Gurmukh Singh vs Risaldar Deva Singh & Ors., AIR 1937 Lahore 577, allowed. Udasis form an independent sect : They do venerate Sikh Scriptures. Therefore, in an institution of Udasis sect, one can visualise reading of Granth Sahib or veneration of Sikh scriptures. That itself is not decisive of the character of the institution. If the succession was from Guru to Chela and those Gurus were followers of Udasi faith and the institution was known as Dera of Udasi Bhekh and they followed some of the practices of Hindu traditional religion that would be completely destructive of the character of the institution as Sikh Gurdwara. [381E F] Mahant Daram Dass etc. vs The State of Punjab & Ors. ; Hem Singh & Ors. vs Basant Das and Anr. , AIR 1936 PC 93 at 100 and Pritam Dass Mahant vs Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee, C.A. No. 1983 of 1970 dated 16.2.84 referred to. In the instant case, there is no evidence to show that the institution was established for use by Sikhs for the purpose of public worship. Though the institution may be established by anyone may be a Sikh or follower of any other faith, but it must be established for use by Sikhs for the purpose of public worship. The original grantor was a Muslim ruler but there is nothing to show that when Gulab Das Faqir of Udasi Sect established the institution, he did it for use by Sikhs for the purpose of public worship. Later on as the majority of the population of the village were followers of Sikh religion and as Udasis also venerate Granth Sahib, reading of Granth Sahib may have commenced and therefore, generally speaking people may describe, and revenue record may show it to be Gurdwara, but that would neither be decisive of the character of the institution nor sufficient to bring the institution within Section 16(2)(iii) of the Act.

But while by notification under section 17 'palm jaggery was exempted from tax 'cane jaggery ' was not. The appellants who were dealers in 'cane jaggery ' challenged the levy by writ petitions in the High Court which were, however, dismissed. In appeal before this Court it was contended (i) that the tax on 'cane jaggery ' while exempting 'palm jaggery ' was ,discriminatory and violative of article 14 of the Constitution; (ii) that taxation of 'cane jaggery ' was restrictive of trade and commerce and therefore violative of article 301; (iii) that the impugned legislation constituted a colourable exercise of power. HELD: (i) The evidence on record clearly showed that 'cane jaggery ' and 'palm jaggery ' were commercially different commodities. The methods of production of 'palm jaggery ' and 'cane jaggery ' were different; they reached the consumers through different channels of distribution; the prices at which they were sold differed and they were consumed by different sections of the community. 'Cane jaggery ' and 'palm jaggery ' did not thus belong to the same class and in differently treating them for the purpose of taxation there was no unlawful discrimination. [620 B E; 621 C D] It was incorrect to say that the State Legislature had always treated the two products on the same footing. For nearly three years before April 1, 1958 sales of 'palm jaggery ' were exempt from tax but sales of 'cane jaggery ' were not. [620 B] Further, it is for the legislature to determine the objects on which tax shall be levied.

It was common ground however that the loan amount, though acknowledged in the mortgage deed as received by the company, was never in fact advanced by the State. The respondent company arranged for the supply of goods as agreed and sought the necessary instructions for delivery, but, these we 're never given. The company instituted a suit in March 1953 against the appellant State for damages for failure to, advance the loan amount and for breach of contract to purchase the groundnut cake. The trial court decreased the suit for Rs. 36,000 being damages for failure to advance the loan and for Rs. 1,23,000 as damages for breach of contract. An appeal to the High Court challenging the liability of the State to compensate the company for failure to take delivery of the goods was dismissed. It was contended on behalf of the State that the obligation to take delivery of the goods agreed to be purchased was contingent upon the Government 's advancing the loan amount, so long as the amount was not advanced by the State, the mortgage was not in law effective and the Company could not enforce the contract relating to ground nut cake a. reed to be purchased by the State. , HELD : Dismissing the appeal) A transaction of mortgage formally executed does not become void or ineffective merely because the mortgagee fails to advance the amount of money undertaken to be advanced by him. Under the terms of the mortgage deed liability of the State to purchase the groundnut cake. from the Company was not made conditional upon the State advancing the loan. By failing to advance the loan amount the State could not avoid liability to carry out the obligation to purchase the goods contracted to be purchased. Even if it be assumed that the indenture incorporated reciprocal promises, in the absence of any express provision to that effect the contract could not be terminated by the default of the State. Breach of contract by one party does not automatically terminate the obligation under the contract : the injured party has the option either to treat the contract as still in existence, or to regard himself as discharged. If he accepts the discharge of the contract by the other party, the contract is 557 at an end. If he does not accept the discharge, he may insist on performance. [560 C D; 561 D].

            "Target: A feud between two families has resulted in tragic consequences. Seventeen lives were lost in the course of a series of five incidents which occurred in quick succession in five different villages, situated in the vicinity of each other, in Punjab, on the night between August 12 and August 13, 1977. The seventeen persons who lost their lives and the three who substained injuries included men, women and children related to one Amar Singh and his sister Piaro Bai. In this connection one Machhi Singh and his eleven companions, close relatives and associates were prosecuted in five sessions cases, each pertaining to the concerned village in which the killings took place. Machhi Singh was the common accused at each trial. The composition of his co accused differed number wise and identity wise from trial to trial At the conclusion of the series of trials, the accused found guilty were convicted under appropriate provisions. Four of them were awarded death sentence, whereas sentence of imprisonment for life was imposed on nine of them. They were also convicted for different offences and appropriate punishment was inflicted on each of them in that behalf. The order of conviction and sentence gave rise to five murder references and fourteen appeals by the convicts before the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. Having lost their appeals and the death sentences having been con firmed, the appellants have come in appeal by way of special leave. The Court considered the following: (a) What normal guidelines are to be followed so as to identify the \"rarest of rare cases\" formula for imposing death sentence, as spelled out in Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab, ; (b) Reliability of eye witnesses to a crime under light shed by the lantern in a village to identify connect an accused to the crime; (c) invocation of the doctrine of benefit of doubt; 414 and (d) the effect of non summoning the magistrate for recording dying declaration. Allowing the Criminal Appeals Nos. 79/81 and 86/81 and dismissing the other appeals, the Court ^ HELD : 1:1. The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability. Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the 'offender ' also require to be taken into consideration alongwith the circumstances of the 'crime '. Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and provided, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances. A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances has to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised. [433 A E] Bachan Singh vs State of Punjab , relied on, 1;2. In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answers : (a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and called for a death sentence ? (b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender. [433 E G] 1:3. If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account the answers to the questions posed here in above, the circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted, the court would proceed to do so. [433 G H] 2. The villagers living in villages where electricity has not reached as yet, get accustomed to seeing things in the light shed by the lantern. Their eyesight gets conditioned and becomes accustomed to the situation. Their powers of seeing are therefore not diminished by the circumstance that the incident is witnessed in the light shed by the lantern and not electric light. Paucity of light cannot, therefore, improbablise the commission of the crime by the accused. [417 C D] 3:1. When a piece of evidence introduced and relied upon by the prosecution itself creates a doubt (a reasonable doubt) as regards the complicity of the accused, even if there are no infirmities in other evidence, the doctrine of benefit of doubt must be invoked by the court in favour of the accused. [422 F G] 415 In the instant case, though there is no infirmity in the evidence of PW Amar Singh and PW Mohindo to connect Mohinder Singh to the crime, the fact that the second rifle used in the commission of crime having been originally issued to one Kashmir Singh does not satisfactorily establish the link. [422 B, E F] 3:2. When the deceased was making good recovery and having regard to the condition of his health, no danger to his life was apprehended and therefore in that fact situation, the magistrate was not summoned, no fault can legitimately be found on this score for getting the benefit of doubt in favour of the accused. Any statement made to the police by such deceased can be subsequently allowed to be treated as dying declaration and evidence scanned. [429 G H] \n",

            "Target: The appellant, who was holding a permanent post in a Central Government department, was selected for the post of Lecturer in a private aided college in Meghalya. The order of appointment stated that it was subject to the approval of the first respondent. On his seeking clarification from the Principal he was assured that the approval was a mere for mality. Acting on the said assurance the appellant resigned his permanent post in the Government department and joined the college. However, he found his services terminated just within five months for want of prior approval of the first respondent. A suit filed by the appellant challenging the order of termination and for a declaration and permanent injunction was dismissed by the trial court. The first Appellate Court found that the Assam Aided Colleges Management Rules, 1965 had not been adopted by the State Government at the time of the appellant 's appointment and that the Director of Public Instruction had acted wrongly in refusing to give approval to the appellant 's appointment, and as such the order of termination of service of the appellant was manifestly wrong. It, therefore, declared appellant 's continuance in service. The High Court while concurring with the view of the first Appellate Court that the termination of services of the appellant was unlawful, awarded one year 's salary and allowances as damages since the 573 appellant did not belong to the category of either Govern ment servants, industrial workmen or employees of statutory bodies, for which alone reinstatement could be ordered. In this appeal by special leave it was contended for the appellant that the Appellate Court and the High Court having found the termination of service to be wrong and illegal, he should have been granted the relief sought for in the suit, that is, a declaration of continuance in service and rein statement with full back wages and allowances. It was fur ther submitted that since the college was a private institu tion provided and by the Government and Government had full supervisory control over it, it was for all practical pur poses a Government institution. As such, he was entitled to parity of treatment with a Government servant wrongly re moved from service. For the respondent it was contended that the only remedy for the appellant was to file a suit for damages and not to seek a declaration of continuance in service, because it would amount to seeking specific per formance of a contract of service. Allowing the Appeal in part, the Court, HELD: The appellant was not entitled to a declaration that he continued to be in the service of the college and that he was entitled to all the benefits flowing from the declaration. [581G] Even though the College in question may be governed by the statutes of the University and the Education Code framed by the Government of Meghalaya and even though the college may be receiving financial aid from the Government, it would not be a statutory body because it haS not been created by any statute and its existence is not dependent upon any statutory provision. [580F G] Vaish College vs Lakshmi Narain, ; and J. Tewari vs Jwala Devi Vidya Mandir & Others, , referred to. There was no violation of the provisions of any Act or any Regulations made thereunder in the instant case. The first respondent in declining to approve the appointment of the appellant had proceeded on the erroneous assumption that the Assam Aided College Employees Rules, 1960 and the Assam Aided College Management Rules, 1965 had been adopted by the State of Meghalya. No doubt such action has been held to be wrongful but even so it was not in contravention of any 574 statutory provisions or regulations or procedural rules. [581E G] I.P. Gupta vs Inter College, Thora, ; , distinguished. The misfortune that has overtaken the appellant was partly due to his own hasty action in resigning his perma nent post and partly on account of the first respondent disapproving the appellant 's appointment on the basis of rules which had not been formulated and communicated to the aided colleges. In spite of the sad plight of the appellant, therefore, it will not be possible to grant the relief of declaration as sought for by him.[578C D] [In the facts and circumstances of the case and in exercise of its powers under Article 136 of the Constitu tion, the Court enlarged the relief grunted to the appellant by the High Court by directing the State of Meghalaya to grant three years salary and allowances to the appellant at the rates prevalent when his services were terminated. It further directed that in the event of there being a vacancy in the College in question for the post of Lecturer in English, and in the event of the Management willing to appoint him as Lecturer once again, the Management should be permitted to do so by granting relaxation of rules and regulations. ] \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant who was a confirmed Auditor in the Office of the Accountant General, Assam responded to an advertisement in the Assam Tribune dated 21.2.75 and offered himself as a candidate for appointment as a Lecturer in English in Lady Keane Girls College, Shillong. On the appellant seeking clarification from the Principal about this condition he was assured that the sanction of approval was a formality and there was no jeopardy to his appointment. Acting on this assurance the appellant resigned his post and joined the College on 2.5.75. The appellant continued to be in service till 20.4.77 on which date the trial court dismissed the suit and vacated the injunction.

            "Target: This is an appeal in a test case arising from sale and rent back transactions in the north east of England. Home owners like the appellant, Mrs Scott, were persuaded to sell their properties to purchasers who promised them the right to remain in their homes for years as tenants after the sale. The purchasers bought the homes with the assistance of mortgages from lenders such as the respondents, who were unaware of the promises made to the home owners. When the purchasers defaulted on the mortgages, possession proceedings were brought by the lenders. The issue arising in this appeal is whether the home owners have any rights entitling them to remain in occupation of their homes, in addition to any claims they may have against the purchasers who may have defrauded them and their legal advisers. Mrs Scott agreed in 2005 to sell her house to an agent for North East Property Buyers (NEPB) at a significant undervalue, in return for the right to remain in her home indefinitely as a tenant at a discounted rent, with the prospect of further capital sums after ten years. The nominee purchaser for NEPB, Ms Wilkinson, obtained a buy to let interest only mortgage from the respondent (Southern Pacific) on condition that only assured shorthold tenancies of up to one year could be granted and on the basis that there were no existing tenancies. In breach of the terms of the mortgage a two year tenancy was granted to Mrs Scott four days after completion of the sale. Three years later Mrs Scott discovered that a possession order had been made on 17 March 2009 in favour of Southern Pacific, following defaults by Ms Wilkinson on the mortgage. Mrs Scott was joined as a defendant to the possession proceedings and argued that she had an equitable interest in the property from the moment of exchange of contracts, which amounted to an unregistered interest given priority by section 29(2)(a)(ii) of, and Schedule 3, paragraph 2 to, the Land Registration Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) over the lenders charges. The courts below determined as a preliminary issue that she had not. Two questions arose: (i) whether Ms Wilkinson had been in a position at the exchange of contracts to confer equitable proprietary rights on Mrs Scott, as opposed to personal rights only, and (ii) whether, even if she had, the transaction of acquiring the legal estate and granting the charge was one indivisible transaction so that Mrs Scott could not assert against Southern Pacific an equitable interest which had only arisen on completion, in accordance with the decision of the House of Lords in Abbey National Building Society v Cann [1991] 1 AC 56 (Cann). The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Collins, with whom Lord Sumption agrees, finds against Mrs Scott on both issues. Lady Hale, with whom Lord Wilson and Lord Reed agree, holds that the appeal must fail because Ms Wilkinson could not confer equitable proprietary rights on Mrs Scott at any time before completion of the purchase. On this basis the second issue does not arise, but they would have taken a different view on the indivisibility of the transaction had it done so. One of the main objectives of land registration is to create as complete a record of title as possible. Overriding interests, to which the land is subject but are not apparent from the register, are an obstacle to this, but the interests of occupiers continue to be protected in the 2002 Act [36]. The unregistered interests which override registered dispositions under the 2002 Act must be proprietary in nature [59]. A purchaser under a contract of sale is given statutory rights to enforce his or her interest against third parties by registration, but it does not follow that the purchaser can grant proprietary rights [65]. Mrs Scott acquired no more than a personal right against Ms Wilkinson when she agreed to sell her house on the basis of the promise made to her that she could remain in occupation and this is the principal ground on which her appeal fails. Her rights only became proprietary when Ms Wilkinson acquired the legal estate, at which time the grant of the charge in favour of Southern Pacific also took effect as part of one indivisible transaction. Accordingly, the lenders rights are not subject to Mrs Scotts right to occupation [79]. It is not therefore necessary to decide whether the decision in Cann applies to a proprietary equitable interest arising at the time of a contract of sale and it is difficult to see how this question could arise in any future case [80]. The justices do, however, express their views on this as it was the main question canvassed in the courts below and at the hearing. Lord Collins considers that it was implicit in Cann that not just the conveyance and mortgage, but also the contract, were all indivisible parts of the transaction. This does not depend on execution of all three on the same day [85]. Thus even if Mrs Scott had had equitable rights of a proprietary nature against Ms Wilkinson arising on exchange of contracts, the mortgage would have taken priority [89]. Lady Hale does not agree that the finding of an indivisible transaction in Cann extends to the contract of sale, and to include the contract would create confusion [120]. She acknowledges that the decision on the principal ground in the appeal produces a harsh result [95] and is uneasy with the all or nothing approach of the present law. She is glad that the Law Commission is now subjecting the 2002 Act to a wide ranging review, to include the impact of fraud [122]. \n",
            "Prediction: The transactions with which this appeal is concerned arose during a period when sale and rent back transactions were common. They were what was described by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) as a relatively new type of property transaction whereby firms bought homes from individuals, usually at a discount, and allowed the former home owners to stay on in the property as tenants. The deals were often sold to home owners in financial difficulties and the firms selling them often told the home owners that they would be able to stay in their homes for years, when in fact the tenancies were rarely granted for more than six or twelve months. Many firms financed the purchase of the properties through secured borrowing, and former owners were being evicted following proceedings for possession by mortgage lenders after the purchasers defaulted on their loans. The home owners did not fully understand the risks involved, and the OFTs research found that solicitors provided by the sale and rental back companies to provide advice to the seller were sometimes suspected to be\n",

            "Target: The Commissioner of Police, Hyderabad and Secunderabad, in exercise of his powers under Section 21(1) of the Hyderabad City Police Act, issued a Notification dated July 8,1986 directing that in order to ensure adequate safety of two wheeler riders, wearing of protective helmets is made compulsory for riders of motor cycles and scooters, as envisaged by rule 498 A of the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1964 with effect from August 1,1986. The petitioner, a student having a permanent driving licence for a two wheeler vehicle, filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the validity of the aforesaid Notification as also rule 499 A of the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicles Rules, l964 on the ground that the same was violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioner under Article 13(1)(d) and Article 21 of the Constitution. It was contended by the petitioner that as Section 85A of the was yet to be enforced, rule 498 A was illegaI and ultra vires the Motor PG NO 632 PG NO 633 Vehicles Act, 1939. It was further contended that the wearing of helmets preventing the free flow of breeze to the head result in giddiness and affect sight and hearing. The petitioner also filed an affidavit of one Dr. Prabhakar Korada to support the contention that continuous wearing of helmets can raise the pressure leading to irritation, confusion, headaches, giddiness and falling of hair etc. The High Court overruled the contentions of the petitioner and upheld the validity of the notification and the provisions of rule 498 A of the A.P. Motor Vehicles Rules. The High Court also relied upon the medical opinions of some Neuro Surgeons of repute, and came to the finding that wearing of helmets would not cause any ailment whatsoever as contended by the petitioner. The writ petition was accordingly dismissed. The petitioner appealed to this Court by Special Leave. It was contended on his behalf that in view of the cancellation of the notification dated May 14, 1988, Section 85 A had not come into force and as such, there was no provision in the providing for wearing of protective headgear or helmet by the driver of a motor cycle of any class while driving the same. It was also submitted that in the absence of any specific provision in the Act, rule 498 A was ultra vires the Act itself and consequently, the notification issued under Section 21(1) of the Hyderabad City Police Act was illegal and should he struck down. As there was some doubt whether Section 85 A had come into force by virtue of the notification dated May l4, I988 and whether the Central Government had the power to cancel the said notification by their subsequent notification dated October 31, l980. the Court issued notice to the Attorney General of India, who appeared and relying on the decision in Om Prakash and Others vs Union of India and Others, AIR l97l SC 771 submitted that even assuming that rule 498 A does not come within the purview of clause (i) of sub section (2) of section 91, still the State Government could frame such a rule under sub section (1) of section 91 and that the clauses under sub section (2) of section 91 are only illustrative and not exhaustive. Dismissing the special leave petition, HELD: 1. Rule 498 A has been framed by the State Government by virtue of its rule making power under clause (i) of sub section (2) of section 19 of the purpose of protecting the head from being injured in case of an accident.[l638E] PG NO 634 2. It is common knowledge that head of the driver of a two wheeler vehicle is the main target of an accident and often it is fatal to the driver. By insisting on the wearing of a helmet by the driver driving a two wheeler vehicle, rule 498 A intends to protect the head from being totally injured in the case of an accident. Clause (i) is wide enough to include the driver of a motor cycle or a scooter. The expression \"any person\"in clause (i) also includes within it a driver of a two wheeler vehicle. [638E F] 3. Clause (i) is also intended for the prevention of danger, injury or annoyance to the public or any person including the driver of a two wheeler vehicle. [638G] 4. Rule 498 A is, therefore, quite legal and valid, in spite of the absence of any provision like section 85 A. [638H] 5. There can be no doubt that rule 498 A is framed for the benefit, welfare and the safe journey by a person in a two wheeler vehicle. It aims at prevention of any accident being fatal to the driver of a two wheeler vehicle causing annoyance to the public and obstruction to the free flow of traffic for the time being.[639G] 6. Even assuming that rule 498 A is not clause (i) of sub section (2), it is quite immaterial inasmuch as such a rule can be framed in exercise of the general power under sub section (1) for the purpose of carrying into effect Chapter V1 relating to control of traffic. [639D] 7. There is hardly any fundamental right against any act aimed at doing some public good. [640A] 8. Even assuming that rule 498 A has put a restriction on the exercise of a fundamental right under Article 19 (1)(b), such restriction being in the interest of the general public, is a reasonable restriction protected by Article 19(5) of the Constitution. [64OB] 9. As rule 498 A has been framed in accordance with procedure established by law, that is, in exercise of the ulre making power conferred on the State Government under Section 19 of the , the question of infringement of Article 21 of the Constitution does not arise [640B] PG NO 635 10. Rule 498 A helps the driver or a two wheeler to drive the vehicle in exercise of his freedom of movement without being subjected to a constant apprehension of a fatal head injury, if any accident takes place.[639H] \n",

            "Target: A charge sheet was filed in the Special Court constituted under the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Special Courts) Act, 1949, against the appellant for an offence under section 409, I.P.C. After the examination of the prosecution witnesses a charge was framed. Thereafter, the prosecution witnesses were cross examined and the accused was questioned under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code. At the time of hearing arguments, the Public Prosecutor placed before the Special Judge two judgments of the High Court according to which the Special Court could not take cognizance upon a charge sheet and that therefore the entire proceedings were without jurisdiction. Though the case was in fact allotted to the Special Judge by a Government notification, he held that he had no jurisdiction to proceed, and as the charge had already been framed, made an order a ,quitting the appellant. A formal complaint against the appellant was then preferred by the Public Prosecutor before the successor in office of the Special Judge and a fresh proceeding was commenced against the appellant which ended in his conviction. His appeal to the High Court was dismissed. In his appeal to this Court, the appellant contended that since he was tried and acquitted upon the same facts by the former Special Judge, his trial over again for the same offence was barred. by section 403 of the Code. HELD: The trial and eventual conviction of the appellant were valid in law, because, the earlier order of the Special Judge did not amount to an order of acquittal as contemplated by section 403(1) It was merely an order putting a stop to the proceedings. Section 403(1) can be successfully pleaded as a bar to a subsequent trial for the same offence or for an offence based on the same facts, where the accused had been (a) tried by a court (b) of competent jurisdiction and (e) acquitted. It is only a court which is Competent to initiate proceedings or to carry them on that can properly make an order of acquittal which will have the effect of barring a subsequent trial upon the same facts and for the same offence. It is true that in the instant case the former Special Judge could have properly taken cognizance of offence because of the allotment and, therefore, the proceedings before him were in fact not vitiated by reason of lack of jurisdiction. But where a court says, though erroneously, that it was not competent to take cognizance of the offence, it has no power to acquit that person of the offence. Therefore, the order a .quitting the appellant was in fact a nullity. [470E; 471A B, H] Yusofalli Mulla Noorbboy vs The King, L.R. 76 I.A. 158, applied. 468 The fact that a charge had been framed Would not help the appellant. A criminal court is precluded from determining the case before it in which a charge has been framed otherwise than by making an order of acquittal or conviction, only where the charge was framed by a competent court. But in the present case, since the former Special Judge was, on his own view, not competent to take cognizance of the offence, he was incompetent to frame the charge. Similarly, the provisions of section 494 of the Code could not be attracted, because, that provision also assumes the withdrawal by a Public Prosecutor of a charge competently made and before a court competent to entertain the withdrawal application. [473C E]. Moreover, the earlier proceedings could not be deemed to be a trial at all, because, for proceedings to amount to a trial, they must be held before a court which is in fact competent to hold them and which is not of the opinion that it has no jurisdiction to hold them.

            "Target: In order to confer permanent status to workmen in var ious industrial establishments, who have put in a continuous service for a period of 480 days in a period of 24 calendar months, the Tamil Nadu Industrial Establishments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981 was passed by the State Government. The constitutional validity of the Act was challenged before the High Court by various industrial establishments by way of writ petitions. The High Court allowed the writ petitions in part, striking down some portions of section 3 of the Act. The State Government preferred appeals against the judgment of the High Court. Meanwhile, the Appellant State amended the Act in the light of the High Court 's judgment. On behalf of the appellant, it was contended that the view taken by the High Court as to the scope of section 3(2) has to be determined notwithstanding the,amendments made. The contention of the respondents was that the legisla ture while amending the Act with retrospective effect has accepted the judgment of the High Court, since the amendment has not given a different meaning to section 3(2) from the one asserted by the High Court. Dismissing the appeals, this Court, HELD: 1. When an Act has been judicially interpreted, Courts 34 may study the subsequent action or inaction of the legisla ture for clues as to legislative approval or disapproval of the judicial interpretation. After the statute has been judicially interpreted in a certain way and if the legisla ture by taking note of the judgment amended the statute appropriately so as to give it a different meaning from the one asserted by the Courts, or not giving any different meaning from the view taken by the Court, it may be argued with some justification that the legislature has expressly or by implication ratified the judicial interpretation. [38G H; 39A] 2. In the instant case, the legislature has expressly taken note of the High Court verdict and removed the practi cal difficulties caused thereby in implementing the provi sions of the Act, by appropriate amendments. No provision, however, was inserted to re write and validate the portion which was struck down by the High Court. It could, there fore, be reasonably held that the legislature has accepted the judgment of the High Court to the extent indicated. [39A B] 3. The view taken by the High Court in striking down a portion of sub section 2 of section 3 of the Act cannot be found fault with. The word 'non employment ' would include retrenchment as well and a person whose services have been terminated or discharged albeit illegal cannot at all be said to be a person in service, much less in continuous service. Therefore, the period of non employment or the period after discharge cannot be accounted for the purpose of giving continuity of service. If the discharge is set aside and workmen is reinstated by process known to law the workman automatically gets continuity of service. No special provision is necessary for such purposes.

            "Prediction: The Tamil Nadu Industrial Establish ments (Conferment of Permanent Status to Workmen) Act, 1981, came into force on 1st January, 1982. The Act was to confer permanent status to workmen in various industrial establishments who have put in continuous service for a period of 24 calendar months in an industrial establishment. The provisions of section 3(2) of the Act are valid except that the 'clause or on account of non employment or discharge of such workman'is void on the ground that it amounts to an unreasonable restriction on the right of the employer. The High Court allowed the writ petitions in part holding, inter alia, that the Explanation to section 3 is incapable of enforcement and must therefore be held to be redundant.

The appellant owned a shop and on a close day the appellant 's son sold an article from the shop, and the appellant was convicted under section 16 of the Act. It was contended on his behalf that section 7 of the Act was ultra vires as it did not fall under any of the items in either the Provincial or the Concurrent Legislative List of the Government of India Act, 1935, and that, in any event as he did not employ any labour and was also the manager of the shop he cannot be convicted in view of the provisions of clauses (i) and (j) of section 2 A of the Act.

The prosecution case was that in connection with the.investigation by the Inspector of Police of a case involving the appellant, the latter went to K 's bungalow and presented to him a closed envelope, that when K found that it contained currency notes he threw it away which the appellant picked up, that thereupon K asked the appellant to produce the currency notes and the appellant complied with the demand that K then gave information to a Magistrate about the attempt made by the appellant to offer him a bribe. The Special judge acquitted the appellant. On appeal, the High Court accepted the prosecution case and convicted the accused. In the High Court Counsel for the appellant entered appearance before notice of appeal under section 422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was issued to the appellant and when the appeal was ready for hearing intimation was given under the rules to the Special judge to communicate to the appellant about the appeal filed against him. The questions for determination were (1) whether the protection under article 20(3) of the Constitution of India had been violated by ask ing the accused to produce the currency notes, and (2) whether the provisions of section 422 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had not been complied with because notice of the appeal had not been served on the appellant. Held, (i) that there was no contravention of article 20(3) as the appellant was not in the position of a person accused of an offence when he was asked to produce the currency notes and that, in any case, on the facts proved the appellant was not compelled to be a witness against him.

            "Target: The Cement Control Order promulgated under the West Bengal Cement Control Act, 1948 prohibits storage for sale and sale by a seller and purchase by a consumer of cement except in accordance with the conditions specified in a licence issued by a designated officer. It also provides that no person shall sell cement at a higher than the notified price and no person to whom a written order has been issued shall refuse to sell cement \"at a price not exceeding the notified price\". Any contravention of the order becomes punishable with imprisonment or fine or both. Under the A.P. Procurement (Levy and Restriction on Sale) Order, 1967, (Civil Appeals Nos. 2488 to 2497 of 1972) every miller carrying on rice milling operation is required to sell to the agent or an officer duly authorised by the Government minimum quantities of rice fixed by the Government at the notified price, and no miller or other person who gets his paddy milled in any rice mill can move or otherwise dispose of the rice recovered by milling at such rice mill except in accordance with the directions of the Collector. Breach of these provisions becomes punishable. It was contended in this Court on behalf of the appellants that the word ,sale\" in the Bengal Finance Sales Tax Act, 1941, must receive the same meaning as in the since the expression \"sale of goods\" was, at the time when the Government of India Act, 1935 was enacted, a term of well recognised legal import in the general law relating to sale goods and in the legislative practice relating to that topic both in England and in India and (2) since under the there can be no sale without a contract of sale and since the parties had no volition but were compelled by law to supply the goods at prices fixed under the Control Orders by the authorities the transactions were not sales and so were not exigible to tax. Disssing the appeals. HELD : Per curiam Sale of cement by the allottees to the permit holders and the transactions between the growers and procuring agents as well as those between the rice millers on the one band and the wholesalers or retailers on the other, are sales exigible to sales tax in the respective States. [465 F G] Per Beg. C.J, The transactions in the instant cases are sales and are exigible to tax on the ratio of Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. Andhra Sugar Ltd. and Karam, Chand Thapar. In cases like New India Sugar Mills, the substance of the concept of a side itself disappears because the transaction is nothing more than the execution of an order. Deprivation of property for a compensation called price does not amount to a sale when all that is done is to carry out an order so that 434 the transaction is substantially a compulsory acquisition. On the other hand, a merely regulatory law, even if it circumscribes the area of free choice, does not take away the basic character or core of sale from the transaction. Such a law which governs a class obliges a seller to deal only with parties holding licences who may buy particular or allotted quantities of goods at specified prices, but an essential element of choice is still left to the parties between whom agreements take place. The agreement despite considerable compulsive elements regulating or restricting the area of his choice, may still retain the basic character of a transaction of sale. In the former type of case, the binding character of the transaction arises from the order directed to particular parties asking them to deliver specified goods and not from a general order or law applicable to a class. In the latter type of cases, the legal tie which binds the parties, to perform their obligations remains contractual. The regulatory law merely adds other obligations, such as the one to enter into such a tie between the parties. Although the regulatory law might specify the terms, such as price, the regulation is subsidiary to the essential character of the transaction which is consensual and contractual. The parties to the contract must agree upon the same thing in the same sense. Agreement on mutuality of consideration, ordinarily arising from an offer and acceptance, imparts to it enforceability in courts of law. Mere regulation or restriction of the field of choice does not take away the contractual or essentially consensual binding core or character of the transaction. [438B D, EG, 439A C, 440B] New India Sugar Mills vs Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar, ; ; [1963] Supp. 2 SCR 459 explained. Commissioner, Sales tax, U.P. vs Ram Bilas Ram Gopal, AIR 1970 All 518, Chittar Mal Narain vs Commissioner of Sales Tax, [1971] 1 SCR 671, Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. vs State of Madras; , , Andhra Sugar Ltd. vs State of Andhra Pradesh ; and State of Rajasthan vs Karam Chand Thapar, AIR 1969 SC 343 referred to. [Per Chandrachud, Bhagwati, Krishna Iyer, Untwalia, Murtaza Fazal Ali and Kailasam, JJ.] According to the definitions of \"Sale\" in the two Acts the transactions between the appellants and the allottees or nominees are patently sales because in one case the property in cement and in the other property in the paddy and rice was transferred for cash consideration by the appellants. [445D] 1. When essential goods are in short supply, various types of Orders are issued under the with a view to making the goods available to the consumer at a fair price. Such Orders sometimes provide that a person in need of an essential commodity like cement, cotton, coal or iron and steel must apply to the prescribed authority for a permit for obtaining the commodity. Those wanting to engage in the business of supplying the commodity are also required to possess a dealer 's licence. The permit holder can obtain the supply of goods, to the extent of the quantity specified in the permit, from the named dealer only and at a controlled price. The dealer who is asked to supply the stated quantity to the particular permit holder has no option but to supply the stated quantity of goods at the controlled price. [440 E G] 2. In State of Madras vs Gannon Dunkerley & Co. Ltd., ; after considering a variety of authorities on the subject, this Court held that the expression sale of goods in Entry 48 List 11 Government of India Act, 1935 cannot be construed in its popular sense and that it must be interpreted in its legal sense. Whereas in popular parlance a sale is said to take place when the bargain is settled between the parties through property in the goods may not pass at that stage, as where the contract relates to future or unascertained goods, the essence of sale in the legal sense is the transfer of property in a thing from one person to another for a price. It was further held that according to the law both of England and India in order to constitute a sale, it is necessary that there should be an agreement between the parties for the purpose of transferring title to the goods which pre supposes capacity to contract, supported by valuable consideration and that as a result of the transaction property must actually pass 435 in the goods. \"Unless all these elements are present, there can 'be no sale. \" The effect of the construction which the Court put on the words of Entry 48 in Gannon Dunkerley is that a sale is necessarily a consensual transaction and if the parties have no volition or option to bargain, there can be no sale. If this view is assumed to reflect the correct legal Position, the transactions in these cases will amount to sales. [447B C, D F, 449D E] 3. Offer and acceptance need not always be in an elementary form, nor does the law of contract or of sale of goods require that consent to a contract must be express. Offer and acceptance can be spelt out from the conduct of the parties which covers not only their acts but omissions as well. On occasions, silence can be more eloquent than eloquence itself. Just as correspondence between the parties can constitute or disclose an offer and acceptance, so can their conduct. This is because law does not require offer and acceptance to conform to any set pattern or formula. [450D E] 4. In the instant case, it is not correct to say that the transactions between the dealer and the consumer were not consensual. The limitations imposed by the Control Order on the normal right of the dealers and consumers to supply and obtain goods, the obligations imposed on the parties and the penalties prescribed by the order do not militate against the position that eventually, the parties must be deemed to have completed the transactions under an agreement by which one party bound itself to supply the stated quantity of goods to the other at a price not higher than the notified price and the other party consented to accept the goods on the terms and conditions mentioned in the permit or the order of allotment issued in its favour by the concerned authority. in order, to determine whether there was any agreement or consensuality between the parties regard must be had to their conduct at or about the time when the goods changed hands. In the first place, it is not obligatory on a trader to deal in cement nor on the consumer to acquire it. The primary fact is that the decision of the trader to deal in an essential commodity is volitional. Such volition carries with it the willingness to trade strictly on the terms of the Control Order. The consumer who is under no legal compulsion to acquire or Possess cement, decides as a matter of his volition to obtain it on the terms of the permit or the order of allotment issued in his favour. That brings the two parties together, one of whom is willing to supply the essential commodity and the other to receive it. When the allottee presents his permit to the dealer, he signifies his willingness to obtain the commodity from the dealer on the terms stated in the permit. His conduct reflects his consent. And when, upon the presentation of the permit the dealer acts upon it, he impliedly agrees to supply the commodity to the allottee on the terms by which he has voluntarily bound himself to trade in the commodity. His conduct too reflects his consent. Thus, though both parties are bound to comply with the legal requirements governing the transaction, they agree as between themselves to enter into the tranaction on statutory terms, one agreeing to supply the commodity to the other on those terms and the other agreeing to accept from him on the very terms. [449E H, 450C, E H,451A] 5. Secondly, though the terms of the transaction are mostly predetermined by law, it cannot be said that there is no area at all for bargain. The conditions provided in the order that cement shall not be sold at a higher than the notified price and that no dealer shall refuse to sell it at a price not exceeding the notified price leaving it open to the individuals to charge and pay a price which is less than the notified price or charge a lesser price. Within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be open to the parties to fix the time of delivery. The consumer has a right to ask for weighment of goods which shows that he may reject the goods if found short in weight or are not of the requisite quality. The consumer has a right to ask for weighment of goods which shows that he tions have the freedom to bargain militates against the view that the transactions are not consensual. [451 AE] 6. In New India Sugar Mills Ltd. the question was whether sugar supplied by the mills on the orders of the Sugar Controller was exigible to tax. The majority held that a contract of sale between the buyer and the seller, which is a pre requisite to a sale, being absent the transaction was not exigible to sales 436 tax. But the principle on which the problem should be approached was set out in the dissenting judgment which said that consent may be express or implied and that it could not be said that unless offer and acceptance were present in an elementary form, there could be no taxable sale. Taking the view that on obtaining the necessary permit the seller on the one hand and the buyer on the other agreed to sell and purchase sugar it was pointed out that when the buyer, after receiving the permit, telegraphed instructions to despatch sugar and the seller despatched it, 'a contract emerged and consent must be implied on both sides though not expressed antecendently to the permit\". So long as the parties trade under controls at fixed price and accept these as any other law of the realm, the contract is at the fixed price, both sides having or deemed to have agreed to such a price. Consent under the law of contract need not be express; it could be implied. [453B G; 454A C] 7.In coming to its conclusion the majority in New India Sugar Mills followed the decision of this Court in Gannon Dunkerley that in a building contract there was no agreement express or implied to sell goods and secondly that property in the building materials does not pass in the materials regarded as goods\" but it passes as part of immovable property. The majority in New India Sugar Mills was in error in saying that the ratio govern that case because the questions involved in both different. In New India Sugar Mills the commodity with concerned was sugar and was delivered as sugar just as in commodity is cement, which was delivered as cement Dunkerley tax was demanded after the commodity had after property in it had passed. The question in this case which was question involved in New India Sugar Mills namely decidendi of Gannon Dunkerley must cases were altogether which the Court was the instant case the Secondly, in Gannon changed hands, that is, the very whether a transaction effected in accordance with the obligatory terms of a statute can amount to a sale, did not arise in Gannon Dunkerley, Gannon Dunkerley is not an authority for the proposition that there cannot at all be a contract of sale if the parties to a transaction are obliged to comply with the terms of a statute. [456C E] 8. In Gannon Dunkerley this Court was influenced largely by the observations in the 8th edn. of Benjamin on \"Sale? ' that to constitute a valid sale there must be a concurrence of four elements, one of which is \"mutual assent\". The majority judgment in New India Sugar Mills also derived sustenance from the same passage in Benjamin 's 8th edn. Gannon Dunkerley involved an altogether different point and is not an authority for the proposition that there cannot at all be a contract of sale if the parties to a transaction are obliged to comply with the terms of a statute. [464E F , 465C D] 9. With the high ideals of the Preamble and the directive principles of our Constitution, there has to be a fundamental change in the judicial outlook. Freedom of contract has largely become an illusion. The policy of the Parliament in regard to the contracts including those involved in sale of goods, has still to reflect recognition of the necessity for a change, which could be done by a suitable modification of the definition of sale of goods.

The order under consideration was actually called a levy order, but the case was distinguishable from New India Sugar Mills vs Commissioner of sales Tax, Bihar (supra) on facts.

            "Target: The respondent are co operative societies of growers of sugarcane who supplied sugarcane to the appellant which is a sugar manufacturing factory. The use and supply of sugarcane is controlled under the provisions of the . The Sugarcane Control order, 1955 empowers the Government to fix the minimum price payable by the manufacturer of sugar to the grower of sugarcane. In 1962, the Sugarcane Control (Additional Powers) Act 1962 came into existence. Pursuant to the Powers conferred by the 1962 Act, the Central Government amended the 1955 Control order by introducing clause 3A providing for payment of additional price for sugarcane purchased by the producers of sugar. The 1955 Control order was repealed and replaced by the Sugarcane Control order 1966. The respondent are recognised by the Government of India and the appellant for the purpose of 1966 Control order. Under the 1966 order the Government was competent to denote an area where sugarcane is grown as a reserved area for factory. The sugarcane grown in that area is required to be sold to the allotted factory. The Government controls all aspects of the use of sugarcane grown in the reserved area. The 1966 order provides for fixation of minimum price of sugarcane payable by manufacturers of sugar to the growers. In determining the minimum price the Government is required to take into account (i) cost of production of sugarcane, (ii) return to the grower from alternative crops and the general trend of prices Of agricultural commodities; (iii) the availability of sugar to the consumer at a fair price; (iv) the price at which sugar is sold by the producers; and (v) the recovery of sugar from sugarcane. The 1966 Control order further provides for payment of additional price in addition to the minimum price. On determination of the price the same ` is required to be intimated in writing to the producers of sugar, growers Co operative Societies of Growers or the local Growers ' Association. An appeal is provided to the Government of India against the determination of the additional price. Clause 5(3) of the 1966 Control order provides that if the Central Government is satisfied that during any year a factory has made no profit or has made inadequate profit that Government may exempt either wholly or partially any producer of sugar from payment of the additional price. The relevant authority under the 1966 Control order fixed additional price payable by the appellants to the respondent. No appeal was preferred either by the appellant or the respondent. The appellants did not pay the additional price. appellant made applications seeking exemption on the ground that the appellants had made inadequate profits. The Government exempted the appellants from paying whose of the additional price for the year 1961 62 and reduced the additional price for the year 1960 61 without giving any opportunity of being heard to the respondent The respondents challenged the validity of the grant of exemption by filing a writ petition in the High Court. The High Court allowed the said writ petition on the ground that the order of the Central Government was violative of principles of natural justice, since no opportunity was given to the respondents to be heard in the matter. 741 Dismissing the appeal by certificate, ^ HELD: (1) Clause 5(1) provides for the payment of additional price and II clause 5(3) provides for exemption from the payment of additional price. Clause 5(5) provides for filing an appeal to the Central Government by any person feeling aggrieved by the decision of the fixation of additional price. The power to grant exemption cannot be said to be independent of the provisions of clause 5 of tho order. The object of 1966 control order is to promote sugar industry and to eliminate unnecessary impediments in The production of sugar. It also ensures a fair deal to the growers of the sugarcane. The provisions of the control order are intended to maintain harmony between the Growers of sugarcane and the producers of sugar and to enable both of them to share profits reasonably. is necessary to give opportunity to be heard both to the growers of the sugarcane as well as the producers of sugar when the Government exercises powers under 1966 Control order for determining the additional price and granting exemption from payment of additional price. [744 H, 745 A E] (2) The grant of exemption from payment of price affects rights and interests of the growers of sugarcane. The order of exemption takes away rights which had accrued in favour of the growers of sugarcane. It is, therefore necessary for the Government to consider the points of view or objections of the growers on the application made by the factories producing sugar seeking exemption from payment of additional price. [745F, G, 746A] (3) The situations in which a duty will arise to act judicially according to. natural justice cannot be exhaustively enumerated. A duty to act judicially will arise in the exercise of power to deprive a person of legitimate interest or expectation that additional price would be paid. The factors which point to an exercise of power judicially are the nature of interest to be affected. the circumstances in which the power falls to be exercised and the nature of the sanctions, if any, involved. [746 C] (4) It is clear that the purpose and purport of the 1966 Control order point to the inescapable conclusion that the sugarcane growers are to be heard not only when additional price is fixed but also when exemption is granted to factories from payment of additional price.

The sugarcane grown in that area is required to be sold to the factory allotted.

According to the agreement the assessee company bad to take the whole of the block of shares belonging to the Sassoons and pay at Rs. 4 4 0 per share Rs. 12 1/2 lakhs for the managing agency. As the assessee company had only RS. 20 lakhs as its paid up capital, it was necessary to sell 13 lakhs odd shares in order to pay off the Sassoons both for the Managing Agency and the shares. Therefore during the course of negotiations the promoters of the assessee company entered into an agreement with some brokers for the sale of Rs. 19,76,000 shares. As a result of the sale of shares the assessee company received a sum of Rs. 16,52.600 as excess over the purchase price which amount on taxation was held by the Income tax Officer not to be profits and therefore not taxable. The case of the assessee company was referred to the Investigation Commission. The Commission found that it was not the intention of the assessee company to retain the whole block of shares and that the sale of 13 lakhs odd shares was an adventure in the nature of trade, and directed that appropriate assessment be made, under the Indian Income tax Act and Excess Profits Tax Act. At the instance of the assessee company the question was referred to the High Court under section 8(5) of the Taxation on Income (Investigation Commission) Act, 1947, which held that there were materials to justify the finding of the Commission that the purchase and sale of about 13 lakhs odd shares was an adventure in the nature of trade. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court against this order. Held, that in considering the question whether the transac tion was or was not an adventure in the nature of trade, the court had to take into consideration the intention of the assessee 918 keeping in view the \"legal requirements which are associated with the concept of trade or business\" In the present case, the transaction that consisted of buy ing the managing agency of the Mill Company and the block of shares held by Sassoons was inescapably one of a commercial nature and had all the attributes of an adventure in the nature If of trade. Held, further, that the jurisdiction which this Court would exercise in appeal was of the same character that a High Court would exercise. Thus the question under article 14 of the Constitution could not be raised in these proceedings because this Court like the High Court was exercising its advisory jurisdiction and its power was confined to the question which arose before the High Court.

            "Prediction: The assessee company was a private limited company which was incorporated on May 6, 1943, with a paid up capital of Rs. 20 lacs. It was promoted by two groups of persons who for the sake of convenience may be called the 'Morarka Group'and the 'Bubna Group '. The promoters of the company entered into an agreement with some share brokers for the sale of a large portion of the total holding of 19,76,000 shares at Rs. 4 4 0 per share, i.e., for Rs. 83,98,000. These shares were to be sold to the promoters or to the company which they were proposing to float. The sale of the Managing Agency and the transfer of the shares was to be simultaneously completed and neither party could require the completion of the one without the other. On November 1, 1943 a tripartite agreement was entered into between the Sassoons as Assignors, the promoters of their company as Confirming Parties\n",

            "Target: The Respondent firm imported from Japan, \"metallised polyester films\" which were in the shape of film rolls several metres long. The goods were cleared on payment of customs duty as well as additional duty/countervailing duty leviable under section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act. Thereaf ter the Respondent firm moved three applications claiming refund of the additional duty of customs paid by it. The claim was made under the terms of a notification of exemp tion issued under section 25(1) of the Customs Act. Under notification No 228/76 dated 2.8.1976, an exemption from the Customs Tariff Act was granted in respect of \"articles made of plastics, all sort but excluding those specified in the Table annexed and failing under Chapter 39 of the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff Act. The Tribunal accepted the claim of refund made by the ' Respondent. In so doing it relied on the decisions of the Madras High Court in Precise Impex P. Ltd. vs Collector, , of the Calcutta High Court in Continental Marketing P. Ltd. vs Union, and of the Bombay High Court in A.V. Jain vs Union, WP 2136 of 1986 decided on 30.1.1987. The Tribunal also referred to its earlier decision in Export India Corporation P. Ltd. vs Collector; and Collector vs Fancy Dying and Printing Works Bombay. The Tribunal held that the goods imported by the Re spondent were articles made of plastics but they were \"films\" and thus not one of the Categories of articles mentioned in the Table. Aggrieved by the decision of the Tribunal, the Collector of Customs has filed these appeals under section 130 E(B) of the . 232 Before this Court the Department contended that the goods are \"sheets\" or \"foils\" or other \"rectangular or profile shape\" and hence liable to duty. The assesses ' assertion is that the goods are \"films\" though specie of plastics articles yet they are different from any mentioned in the table. According to it even if they are treated only as thin sheets of plastic material, they can be described only as \"sheetings\" and not sheets. On consideration of the rival contentions advanced by the parties and after making reference to the other relevant notifications granting exemption issued under rule 8(1) of the Central Excise Rules in respect of items falling under Item No. 15A of the Central Excise Tariff Act, this Court dismissing the appeals, HELD: Films made of plastic fall in a category of their own and do not fail within the categories of articles ex cepted by the Table. Film is a well known, distinct and independent category of plastic article known to commerce. [235A] The Court agreed with the view of the Bombay High Court that, though for certain purposes there is a distinction between \"films\", \"foils\" and \"sheets\", so far as the article presently in question is concerned it is recognised in trade only as \"film\". [238F] The goods under consideration cannot be described either as \"foils or sheets\". A film roll of indefinite length and not in the form of individual cut piece can be more appro priately described as \"sheetings\" rather than ' 'sheets\". [238G ;239A] The expression \"other rectangular or profile shapes\" in the table is also not appropriate to bring in the items in question. For one thing, the articles have a distinct name in the market as \"films\" and therefore they are outside the table. It will not be possible to accept the contention that articles which have a clear commercial identity as \"films\" should be brought within the wide and vague expression \"other rectangular or profile shapes\", because if the film is cut into small pieces each piece will be rectangular in shape. The items imported do not come in a rectangular shape they are imported as rolls of polyester films. They are not articles of rectangular shape. Nor would it be possible to treat them as of other \"profile\" shape. The Court was unable to attribute any precise meaning to the expression \"profile\" shape but it cannot be taken to be comprehensive enough to take in any shape whatever. If the expression \"rectangular\" or other \"profile\" shape in the table is given 233 such wide and unrestricted interpretation then practically any article of plastic can be brought within the meaning of one or other of the expressions used in the Table and thus the entire exemption can be altogether deprived of any content. The Court took the view that the articles are \"films\" and, as, this expression does not find specific mention in the table, the assessee is entitled to exemption under the main part of the notification.

            "Prediction: The respondent imported, from Japan, \"metallised poIyester films\" under an import licence dated 14.6.1978. The goods were admittedly in the shape of film rolls several metres long. They were cleared on payment of customs duty leviable under the (CA) as well as the additional duty of customs (or countervailing duty) leviable from the (51 of 1975). Subsequently, the respondent made three applica tions for refund of the amount of customs paid by it. The claim for refund was based on the terms of a notification of exemption issued under section 25(1) of the CA. Under notification No. 228/76 dated 2.8.1976, an exemption from the customs duty payable under section 3 of the CTA was granted in respect of \"articles made of plastics, all sorts, but excluding those specified in the table an nexed hereto and falling within Chapter 39 of the First Schedule to the Customs Tariff\n",

            "Target: Respondent No. 1 a Private Limited Company, was sanctioned a loan of Rs.30 lakh by the Appellant Corporation for the setting up of a factory. To secure this loan a mortgage deed of certain properties was executed by the Company and Respondents 2 to 4 as its directors had executed a personal Surety Bond without any security for its repayment. After obtaining a part of the sanctioned loan, which was to be given in phases, the Company became disinterested in availing of the balance amount. Consequently the Corporation demanded back the amount ahead taken together with interest and on the company 's failure to do so, it took over the Industrial Concern under section 29 of the Act and initiated steps to realise its dues by putting the property to sale. Having failed to recover the amount as no adequate offer was forthcoming despite repeated advertisements, it filed a petition before the Bombay High Court under sections 31 and 32 of the Act both against the Company as well as its directors sureties praying for a decree in the sum of Rs. 15,87,391.20 to be passed against them jointly and severally. The respondents contested the petition contending (a) that a petition under sections 31 and 32 of the Act could be filed only before the City Civil Court and the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain it, (b) that no money decree can be passed under sections 31 and 32 of the Act, and (c) that the provision in the Act relating to enforcement of the 481 liablity of surety were ultra vires of Article 149 of the Constitution. The learned single judge relying on an earlier decision of the Bombay High Court reported in 1987 Mah. L.J 243 held that the High Court had to entertain the petition but on merits took the view that no money decree could be passed under sections 31 and 32 even against the sureties and since in the instant case the sureties had not given any security except their personal guarantee, the same could be enforced only in the ordinary course and not under the special machinery provided under the Act. In view of his findings on the first two pleas no arguments were entertained on the last plea and accordingly the petition was dismissed. The Division Bench while dismissing the appeal not only upheld the finding of the single Judge on merits but also overruled the decision reported in and held that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain a petition under sections 31 and 32 of the Act. The Corporation came up in appeal before this court by special leave against this decision of the High Court of Bombay. The impugned judgement was assailed by the Appellant Corporation both on merites and on the plea of juridiction. The respondents in reply asserted that the findings of the High Court on both pleas were unassailable. Allowing the appeal, by a majority decision, HELD: A. By the Full Court (i)The extent of the liability stated in the application as contemplated by sub section (2) of section 31 of the Act would represent the value of the claim of the Corporation and if since value is upto Rupees Fifty Thousand, the application would lie in the City City Court and if it is more than that amount it would lie in the High Court. This interpretation would give meaning and relevance to the words \"having jurisdiction\" used in sub section (11) of section 32. A different interpretation would render superfluous or otiose not only the words \"having jurisdiction\" but also the words and in the absence such court, by the High Court, occurring in the said sub section (11) inasmuch as in a Presidency town, in terms of territorial jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of the City Civil Court and of the High Court is co terminus [495D F] (ii) In the instant case the extent of liability of the surety being more than Rupees fifty thousand, the application could only have been filed and was rightly filed in the High Court and the finding in the 482 judgment under appeal to the contrary for holding that the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the application cannot be sustained. [497A] B. Per N. D. Ojha, J. for himself and Ranganathan, J. (iii) There can be no doubt that the term, \"any surety\" used in clause (aa) in sub section (1) of section 31 of the Act, will include not only a surety who has given some security but also one who has given only a personal guarantee. In our opinion, in a case where the relief claimed in the application under section 31(1) of the Act is for enforcing the liability of a surety who has given only a personal guarantee, sub section 4(A) of section 32 where no cause is shown and clause (da) of sub section (7) where cause is shown, contemplate cutting across and dispensing with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure from the stage of filing a suit to the stage of obtaining a decree against the surety, the passing of an order which can straightaway be executed as if it were a decree against the surety which may be passed in the event of suit being filed. [498F, 499E] (iv) In the absence of any provision such as sub section (8) of section 32 of the Act applying the manner provided in the Code for the execution of a decree against a surety only \"as far as practicable\" the entire provision contained in this behalf in the Code shall be applicable. This would be so in view of the use of the expression \"any other law for the time being applicable to an industrial concern\" used in section 46B of the Act. That the Code is applicable to an industrial concern also is not in dispute and cannot be doubted. [50OH 501A] (v) Even in the absence of section 46B of the Act the provisions of the Code would have been attracted in the matter of enforcing the liability of a surety in view of the decision of this Court in National Sewing Thread Co. Ltd. vs James Chadwick & Bros. Ltd., ; inasmuch as the District Judge while exercising jurisdiction under sections 31 and 32 of the Act is not a persona designate but a court of ordinary civil jurisdiction. [501B D] (Per section C. Agrawal, J. Dissenting.) It cannot be comprehended that while making provision which would enable passing of an order in the nature of a money decree against a surety on an application under section 31 of the Act, Parliament would have refrained from making a corresponding provision prescribing the procedure for carrying into effect such an order. It 483 appears to be more in consonance with the scheme of the Act and the object underlying sections 31 and 32 that by introducing the amendments in sections 31 and 32 of the Act the Parliament intended to place the surety on the same footing as the principal debtor so as to enable the Financial Corporation to obtain relief against the properties of the principal debtor as well as the surety [515E G] If considered in this perspective, the expression \"enforcing the liability of any surety\" in clause (aa) of section 31(1) would mean enforcing the liability of a surety in the same manner as the liability of principal debtor is enforced, by attachment and sale of property keeping in view that the proceedings under sections 31 and 32 of the Act are akin to an application for attachment of property in execution of a decree at a stage posterior to the passing of the decree. The relief of a money decree sought against the sureties respondents 2 to 4 was not maintainable and the said relief could not be granted to the appellant in proceedings under section 31 of the Act. As a result, the petition filed by the appellant must be dismissed and for the same reason this appeal must fail.

            "Prediction: Respondent No. 1, for setting up a factory, sought financial assistance from the appellant and the appellant sanctioned a loan of Rupees thirty lakhs. The amount of loan was to be advanced in phases and after the Corporation had advanced a part of the total sanctioned loan, the Company did not want to avail of the balance of the amount as it seems to have lost interest in setting up the factory for reasons with which we are not concerned. The Corporation consequently called upon the appellant to repay the amount already advanced together with interest and on its failure to do so took possession under Section 29 of the (for short the Act) over the industrial concern, a term defined under Section 2(c) of the Act and took steps to realise its outstanding dues by transfer of property in the manner provided therein.

            "Target: % There is a Math known as Juna Math in Bikaner. The first appellant is the present Mahant of the Math and the second appellant is the presiding deity of the Math, both referred to collectively as 'the Math ', herein. Previously, one Lalgiri Maharaj was the Mahant of the Math. He mismanaged the Math and disposed of its properties. On August 19, 1963, he gave on lease for 99 years land measuring 2211 sq. yards in favour of Madan Mohan, the respondent No. 1. On March 22, 1968, he sold to Madan Mohan 446 sq. yards of land out of the land leased to him. Madan Mohan constructed shops on the land purchased and sold them to Jankidas and Mohan Lal, who are respondents Nos. 2 and 3. Then Madan Mohan sold another piece of land purchased from Lalgiri to the respondents Nos. 2 and 3. Later, the first appellant became the Mahant of the Math, and the Math filed a suit, challenging the alienations made by Lalgiri, and for a declaration that the said alienations were without authority and not binding on the Math and for possession of the property from the respondents 1 to 3. The trial Court decreed the suit in part only, as it gave a declaration that the lease deed dated August 19, 1963, was null and void, but the relief regarding possession of the land demised was rejected. The suit for recovery of possession of the land sold by Lalgiri was also dismissed. Against the judgment of the Trial Court, two appeals one by the Math and the other, by Madan Mohan were filed before the High Court. By a common judgment in the two appeals, a single Judge of the High Court (i) allowed the appeal of the Math in part, giving a simple declaration that the sale of the land was void, but declining to pass a decree for possession of the land sold, and (ii) allowed the appeal of 680 Madan Mohan, giving him complete relief, while holding that the suit as to the lease was barred by time. Against the judgment of the Single Judge, no appeal was filed either by the Math or by Madan Mohan. There was only an appeal filed by respondents 2 and 3, who impleaded the Math as the first respondent and Madan Mohan, as the third respondent. The Math Preferred cross objection. Madan Mohan did not do any thing. The Division Bench of High Court dismissed the appeal on the merits. It also dismissed the cross objection on the ground of maintainability. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the cross objection, the Math appealed to this Court for relief by special leave. Allowing the appeal, the Court, ^ HELD: The Single Judge invalidated the sale of the property to Madan Mohan, while denying a decree for possession. The appellants before the Division Bench wanted to get rid of the finding as to the invalidity of the sale. The Math wanted to recover possession of the property from the appellants before the Division Bench, and Madan Mohan. The Math instead of filing an appeal for that relief, could as well file the cross objection. That is clear from the provisions of R. 22 of 0.41, C.P.C. The High Court was clearly in error in holding to the contrary. [684G H] The next question for consideration was whether the cross objection was maintainable against Madan Mohan, a co respondent, and if not, whether the Court could call into aid R. 33, 0.41 C.P.C. Generally, the cross objection could be urged against the appellant. It is only by way of exception to this general rule that one respondent may urge objection as against the other respondent. The type of such exceptional cases are very much limited when an appeal cannot be effectively disposed of without opening the matter as between the respondents inter se, or when there is a case where the objections are common as against the appellants and the co respondent. This law has been laid down by this Court in Panna Lal vs State of Bombay, ; at 991. This view has been accepted as a guide for more than two decades. No attempt should be made to unsettle the law unless there is a compelling reason. The Court does not find any such compellmg reason in the case. [685A, H; 686A B; 687A B] The Math could urge the objection that the appellants before the Division Bench and Madan Mohan had no right to retain the property 681 after the sale deed had been declared null and void. The validity of the lease deed and the possession of the land in pursuance thereof, has to be determined only against Madan Mohan. It is not intermixed with the right of the appellants above said. It has no relevance to the question raised in the appeal. The High Court was right in holding that the cross objection as to the lease was not maintainable against Madan Mohan. But that does not mean that the Math should be left without a remedy against the judgment of the Single Judge. If the cross objection filed under R. 22 of 0.41, C.P.C. was not maintainable against the co respondent, the Court could consider it under R. 33, 0.41, C.P.C. R. 22 and R. 33 are not mutually exclusive. They are closely related with each other. If objection cannot be urged under R. 22 against corespondent, R. 33 could take over and help the objector. The appellate Court could exercise that power in favour of all or any of the respondents even though such a respondent may not have filed any appeal or objection. The sweep of the power under R. 33 is wide enough to determine any question not only between the appellant and the respondent but also between a respondent and co respondents. The appellate Court could pass any decree or order which ought to have been passed in the circumstances of the case. The appellate Court could also pass such other decree or order as the case may require. The words \"as the case may require\" used in R. 33 of 0.41, have been put in wide terms to enable the appellate Court to pass any order or decree to meet the ends of justice. This Court is not giving any liberal interpretation. The rule itself is liberal enough. The only constraint that could be seen, may be: that the parties before the lower Court should be there before the appellate Court, the question raised must properly arise out of the judgment of the lower Court; it may be urged by any party to the appeal. It is true that the power of the appellate Court under R. 33 is discretionary, but it is a proper exercise of judicial discretion to determine all the questions urged in order to render complete justice between the parties. The Court should not refuse to exercise that discretion on mere technicalities. [687B H; 688A B] Appeal allowed. The judgment and decree of the Division Bench of the High Court reversed. The Division Bench to restore the appeal and cross objection of the parties and dispose of the same in accordance with law and in the light of the observations made. [688C] \n",
            "Prediction: One Lalgiri Maharaj was a previous Mahant of the Math. He had several vices. He mismanaged the Math and recklessly disposed of its properties. On August 19, 1963 he gave on lease a piece of land measuring 2211 Sq. yards in favour of Madan Mohan. The lease was for 99 years with monthly rent of Rs. 30. In the meantime, there was change of guard in the Math, which was said to have abdicated Mahantship. The suit as to the lease was barred by time. The trial court decreed the suit in part and the trial court gave only a declaration that the lease deed was null and void. The relief for possession of the land demised was rejected.

            "Target: As a result of the 'Indo Pakistan Agreements ' entered into in 1956 between the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan half of the area known as Barubari Union No. 12, and a portion of Chilahati village admeasuring 512 acres were agreed to be transferred by India to Pakistan. Certain questions arising out of the implementation of the sand Agreements were referred by the President under article 143 (1) of the Constitution, to this Court, and were answered by this Court in Special Reference No. 1 of 1959. In accordance with the answers therein given, Parliament passed the Constitution (Ninth Amendment) Act, 1960. There was provision in the Act for a date, to be appointed by notification in the Official Gazette, for the transfer of the areas in question of Pakistan. In regard to Berubari Union No. 12 the Second Schedule to the Amending Act, inter alia, This will be so divided as to give half the area to Pakistan, the half adjacent to India being retained by India. The division of Berubari Union No. 12 will be horizontal, starting from the north east comer of Debiganj Thana. \" The appellants filed a writ petition in the High Court of Calcutta challenging the legality of the proposed transfer of the said areas of Berbubari Union No. 12 and Chilahati village to Pakistan. The language of the Amending Act in regard to Berubari Union No., 12 was, they urged, so confused that it was incapable to implementation. In regard to Chilahati village they urged that it was outside the Radcliffe Award. Reliance was placed by them on an unofficial map, Ext. The High Court found that Ext. A 1 was inadmissible and unreliable. Relying on the maps produced by the respondents it dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellants who, with certificate, appealed to this Court. It was urged on behalf of the appellants : (1) If the division of Barubari Union No. 12 was made as directed by the said amendment no portion of Berubari Union No. 12 would fall to the south of the horizontal line starting from the north cast corner of Debiganj Thana, so that no part of the said Union could be transferred to Pakistan. (2) The High Court erred in holding that map Ext. A 1 was neither relevant nor accurate. (3) The location of different villages in the various Thanas was a matter within the special knowledge of the respondents and under section 106 of the Evidence Act the onus of proving the relevant facts was on the respondents. (4) The portion of Chilabati village in question was different from the village of Chilabati which bad gone to Pakistan under the Radcliffe Award, as was shown not only by maps but by certain private documents which described Chilabati as part of Jalpaiguri Thana. (5) Entry 13 in the First Schedule to the Constitution provides, inter alia, that West Bengal means the territories which immediately before the commencement of the Constitution were either comprised in the Province of West Bengal or were being administered 'as if ' they formed part of that Province. 'Me portion of Chilahati in question was being administered 'as if ' it was a part of the Province of West Bengal and must be deemed to have been included 431 in the territory of West Bengal within the meaning of the First Schedule,, and if that was so, it was a part of the territory of India under article 1 of the Constitution. It could not therefore be ceded to Pakistan without following the, procedure laid down by this Court in Special Reference No. 1 of 1959. (6) In any case Pakistan 's title to Chilahati had been lost by adverse possession. HELD : (i) It had not been proved that Ext. A 1, relied on by the appellants, was generally offered for public sale. The requirements of section 36 of the Evidence Act were thus not satisfied and Ext. A 1 was irrelevant. Even if the said map was treated as relevant its accuracy had not been established and no presumption as to its accuracy could be made under section 83 of the Evidence Act, since the requirements laid down in the first part of the section were not satisfied, [440 E H] (ii) Me location of ' villages of different Thanas could not be regarded as a matter within the exclusive knowledge of the respondents so as to attract the provisions of section 106 of the Evidence Act. Both parties had; produced maps, the High Court refused to accept the maps produced by the appellants and treated the maps produced by the respondents as worthy of credence. Under the circumstances no question of onus really arose. [441 G H] (iii) The map produced by them having been rejected by the High Court, the appellants were hardly in a position to contend that they had established their plea that the relevant portion of the Constitution Amendment Act was incapable of implementation. [442 D E] (iv) When it was said that the division of Berubari Union No. 12. would be 'horizontal ' starting from the north east corner of Debiganj Thana it was not intended that it was to be made by a mathematical line in the manner suggested by the appellants. The provision did not refer to any line as such, it only indicated broadly the point from which the division was to begin east to west , and it emphasised that in making the said division what had to be borne in mind was the fact that the Union in question was to be divided half and half. The contentions of the appellants in regard to Berubari Union No. 12 were therefore rightly rejected by the High Court. [442 H 443 D] (v) The materials on record showed that the contention of the appellants that Chilahati village formed part of Thana Jalpaiguri was incorrect : it clearly lay within Debiganj Thana and under the Radcliffe Award had been allotted to Pakistan. The private documents produced by the appellants for the purpose of showing that a part of Chilahati village lay in jalpaiguri Thana were rightly rejected by the High Court, as in view of the maps produced by !he respondents it was difficult to attach any importance to the recitals by individuals in their respective documents. It was plain that through inadvertence a part of village Chilahati was not delivered to Pakistan on the occasion of the partition which followed the Radcliffe Award. What the respondents proposed to do wag to transfer to Pakistan the area in question which really belonged to her. This conduct of the respondents spoke of their fair and straightforward approach to this matter. [444 E 45 D] (vi) The clause 'as if ' in Entry 13 of the First Schedule to the Constitution was not intended to take in cases of territories which were administered with the full knowledge that they did not belong to West Bengal ' and had to be transferred in due course to Pakistan. 'Me said clause was clearly and specifically intended to refer to territories which merged with the adjoining States at the crucial time and so it could not include the part of Chilahati administered by West Bengal. It would be idle to contend 432 that by virtue of the accidental fact that this area had not been transferred to Pakistan, though it should have been, it had constitutionally and validly become a part of West Bengal itself. That being so, there could be no question about the constitutional validity of the proposed transfer of this area to Pakistan. What the respondents were seeking to do was to give to Pakistan what belonged to Pakistan under the Radcliffe Award. [448 A E] (vii) The Plea of adverse possession was not raised by the appellants in their writ petition. Besides it was plain that neither the Union of India nor the State of West Bengal, which were impleaded to the present proceedings, made such a claim. It would indeed be surprising that even though the Union of India and the State of West Bengal expressly said that this area belonged to Pakistan under the Radcliffe Award and had to be delivered to Pakistan, the petitioners should intervene and contend that Pakistan 's title to this property had been lost because West Bengal had been adversely in possession of it. [448 G H] (viii) In Special Reference No. 1 of 1959 it had been inadvertently assumed while discussing the several clauses of article 3 that the word 'State ' used therein did not include Union Territories. In view of section 3 (58) (b) of the General Clauses Act (10 of 1897) this assumption was not correct. However the opinion of the Court in that Reference was not based mainly on the above assumption, but on the view that the power to cede a part of national territory and the power to acquire additional territory were the inherent attributes of sovereignty.

            "Target: The assessee. who was a manufacturer of iron shut ters, fabricates the different parts ,and components and fits them into shutters. The shutters are prepared ac cording to the specific requirements of the customer and fixed in the customer 's premises. Though the masonary work connected with the fitting of the shutters was done by the customer, it was done according to the contractor 's instruc tions. The contract was complete after the shutters were taken to the premises of the customer and affixed to the building; and when fitted into the walls the shutters become permanently embedded into the wall and are not detachable. The price charged by the contractor from the customer was a lumpsum and did not show a break up, of the materials used or fabricated or the cost of services or labour. The assessee claimed that the contract being a works con tract the proceeds from such contracts are not exigible to tax. But this plea was rejected by the Sales Tax Officer. The assessee 's appeal was rejected by the Assistant Commis sioner (judicial). The Judge (Revisions) Sales Tax upheld the assesee 's contention. On reference the High Court held that the contract was not a works contract but a contract for the supply of goods simpliciter. Allowing the assessee 's appeal, HELD . The contract in the present case was a works contract and the transaction was not exigible to tax. The High Court was in error in holding that the assessee was liable to pay tax on the sale proceeds of the contract [171E] (1) The question whether a contract can be said to be a works contract has to depend on the facts of each case. It is difficult to lay down any rule of universal application but some of the important tests evolved by this Court are: [168 H] (i) Where the contract was primarily a contract for the supply of materials at a price agreed to between the parties for the materials so supplied and the work or service ren dered is incidental to the execution of the contract. the contract is one for sale of materials and the sale proceeds would be exigible to sales tax. [169 A B] (ii) Where the contract is primarily for work and la bour, and materials are supplied in execution of such con tract, there is no contract for sale of materials but it is a works contract. The circumstance that the materials have no separate identity as a commercial article and it is only by bestowing work and labour upon them, that is, by affixing them to the building would be prima facie indicative of a works contract. Where certain materials are not merely supplied but fixed to an immovable property so as to become a permanent fixture and an accretion to the said property, the contract ' prima facie would be a works contract. [169 C] In the instant case the transaction was a composite, consolidated contract which was one and indivisible compris ing labour and services executed for a lumpsum. The con tract could be completed when materials with various compo nent parts had been taken to the site, fitted into one another and then finally fixed into a frame so that the fixture became permanent and a, part of 166 the premises. This operation could not be, said to be merely incidential to the contract, but was fundamental part of the contract itself. [168 F & 170 A] (2) It is not correct to say that the contract could not be a works contract because the price was paid in advance and the title passed to the customer as soon as the shutters were packed and despatched to the site. Advance payment of the price was a term meant for the convenience of the par ties as the contractor did not want to take any risk for delayed payment; the contract would be completed only after the shutters were finally assembled at the site and fixed according to specifications, which was essentially the responsibility of the contractor.

In the assessment year 1965 66 the assessee received an aggregate sum of Rs. 1,08,633 08 in the execu tion of such contracts.

            "Target: The age of superannuation for the employees of the private transport company in which the appellant was ini tially employed was 60 years. When the said company was taken over by the State on August 31, 1955, the notification specifically provided that the existing staff would not be adversely affected with regard to terms and conditions of service. Again, when the services 01 the staff of the taken over company were transferred to the respondent Corpo ration established under section 3 of the Road Transport Corpora tion Act, 1950, the memorandum dated May 4, 1962 recited the same assurance. A resolution passed by the Board of Direc tors of the Corporation on the same day also reiterated the said assurance. Subsequently, when the State Government issued directions on October 29, 1963 to the Corporation under section 34 of the Act the said assurance was embodied therein too. However, Regulation 59 of the M.P. State Road Transport Corporation Employees Service Regulations, 1964 framed by the Corporation under section 45(2)(c) of the Act provided that the employees of the Corporation were liable to compulsory retirement on the date of their completion of 58 years of age unless specifically permitted to continue. When the appellant was sought to be retired from service in terms of Regulation 59 of the said Regulations on attain ing the age of 58 years with effect from June 30, 1984 by a notice dated May 25, 1983, he challenged it by a petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution. It was dismissed by the High Court on the view that on August 31, 1955 when the appellant became State Government employee his age of superannuation came to be governed by the statutory rules under Article 309 of the Constitution and the age of retire ment of the State servants under the said rules being 58 years the appellant was rightly retired. 329 Allowing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1. The appellant was entitled to continue in service upto the age of 60 years. 2.1 When the State Government takes over a private company and gives an assurance that conditions of service of the existing staff would not he adversely affected, it is but fair that the State Government should honour the same. 2.2 In the instant case, the appellant was in service of the company from 1947 to August 30, 1955 in which the age of superannuation of the employees was 60 years. The company was taken over by the State Government with effect from August 31, 1955 by a notification of the same date which specifically stated that the existing staff of the company would not he adversely affected with regard to their condi tions of service. The State Service Rules which fixed the age of superannuation at 58 years could not thus he made applicable to the appellant and other employees of the taken over company. Furthermore, the said assurance was also incorporated in the directions issued by the State Government to the Corporation under section 34 of the Act. The Corporation could not frame regulations contrary to the said directions and the age of superannuation which the appellant was enjoying under the State Government could not he altered to his disadvantage by the Corporation. Regulation 59 framed by the Corporation was, therefore, not applicable to the appellant. The General Manager, Mysore State Road Transport Corpo ration vs Devraj Ors and Anr., , referred to. Since the appellant had already attained the age of 60 years, he was only entitled to two years emoluments. The respondents are directed to pay the same to him within three months. [334B] \n",

The State Government of the composite State of Punjab issued a notification under section 6 giving its intention to delete from Schedule pure silken fabrics from the list of tax free goods. Before the issue of any further notification, however, the composite State was reorganised and the Union Territory of Chandigarh was formed. The Government of the Union Territory of Chandigarh issued a notification amending item 30 of Schedule as intended to be amended by the notification issued by the former government. In a writ petition filed before the High Court the respondent challenged the notification as invalid on the ground that the earlier notification could not be availed of by the new Government for amending Schedule B. The appellant claimed that the earlier notification was \"law in force\". But the High Court repelled this argumenet It allowed the respondent 's writ Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: 1. There was no \"law in force\" enabling the newly formed Union 'Territory of Chandigarh to levy any sales tax on pure silken fabrics. The notification merely notifying the intention of the State Government to add or delete from Schedule any article by itself had no force of law until and unless, on the expiry of the period of three months, a like notification was issued amending the Schedule. The erstwhile State Government of Punjab could not issue the second notification in respect of the Union Territory after it ceased to be a part of the State of Punjab. Sales Tax could not be charged on pure silken fabrics by the said State Government merely by virtue of the notification. It was therefore not a law in force when the composite State was reorganised.

Tewari who had been appointed in November, 1984 as a Minister of the Government of Uttar Pradesh under Article 164(1) of the Constitution by the Governor of the State of Uttar Pradesh even though Shri Tewari was not a member of either House of the State Legislature. The petitioner contended (i) that in the judgment of Har Sharan Verma vs Shri Tribhuvan Narain Singh, Chief Minister of U.P. and Anr., (AIR where it had been held that the appointment of a person as Chief Minister could not be challenged on the ground that he was not a member of the Legislature of a State at the time of appointment, this Court had not considered the effect of the amendment of Article 173 (a) of the Constitution by the Constitution (Sixteenth) Amendment Act, 1963; (ii) that after the amendment of Article 173 of the Constitution by the Constitution (Sixteenth) Amendment Act, 1963 it was not open to the Governor to appoint a person who was not a member of the Legislature of the State as a Minister and that Article 164(4) of the Constitution would only be applicable to a person who had been a Minister but who ceased to be a member of the Legislature for some reason such as the setting aside of his election in any election petition; and (iii) that the debates of the Constituent Assembly suggested that a person should be a member of the Legislature at the time of his being chosen as a Minister. Dismissing the petition, ^ HELD: (I) By the Sixteenth Amendment clause (a) of Article 173 of the Constitution is amended by the addition of a clause which requires a candidate at an election to the Legislature to make and subscribe before some person authorised in that behalf by the Election Commission an oath or affirmation 548 according to the form set out for the purpose in the Third Schedule to the Constitution. Earlier it was only after a person was elected or nominated as a member of the Legislature of a State that he was required by Article 188 of the Constitution to make and subscribe an oath or affirmation before taking his seat as such member in the form mentioned in the Third Schedule to the Constitution. The above requirement has to be complied with by an elected or nominated member of the State Legislature even after the Sixteenth Amendment. [550H; 551A; E;H] (2) The object of introducing the amendment in clause (a) of Article 173 of the Constitution was to provide that not only before taking his seat shall a member of the Legislature take the oath prescribed by the Third Schedule as required by Article 188 of the Constitution but that even before standing for election, a candidate must take the same oath. This is to ensure that only a person having allegiance to India shall be eligible for membership of the Legislature. [552C D] (3) Article 177, ensures the implementation of the constitutional principle contained in clause (2) of Article 164 of the Constitution which provides that the Council of Ministers shall be collectively responsible to the Legislative Assembly of the State. A Minister in a State under our Constitution discharges that responsibility by virtue of the provisions contained in Article 177 of the Constitution which enables him to participate in the proceedings of the Legislative Assembly even though he may not be its member with the right to vote.[553F;G] (4) It does not appear that the debates of the constituent Assembly suggest that a person shall be a member of the Legislature at the time of his being chosen as a Minister. An amendment was proposed to that effect in the Constituent Assembly to the draft Constitution but was not accepted: [553H; 554A C] (5) The fear expressed by the petitioner that a person who does not owe his allegiance to the Constitution and is not willing to uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India would have an opportunity to become a Minister if he is not required to become a member of the Legislature after having made and subscribed an oath or affirmation as prescribed by Article 173(a) of the Constitution is not well founded because under clause (3) of Article 164 of the Constitution a Minister for a State is required to take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution and to undertake to uphold his office in the from prescribed in the Third Schedule. [554C E] (6) No material change has been brought about by reason of the amendment of Article 173(a) of the Constitution in the legal position that a person who is not a member of the State Legislature may be appointed as a Minister subject, of course, to clause (4) of Article 164 of the Constitution according to which a Minister who for any period of six consecutive months is not a member of the Legislature of the State shall at the expiration of that period cease to be a Minister.

            "Target: The continuance of a dispute even for a long period of time between two sets of rival claimants to the property of a private person is not a circumstance of such unusual nature as Would invest a case with special or exceptional features and make it a class by itself justifying its differentiation from all other cases of succession disputes, and the fact that a non judicial authority had made a report against one set of the claimants is not a reasonable ground for depriving them by legislation of their ordinary rights under the law and prohibiting them from having resort to courts of law for establishing their rights. A nobleman of Hyderabad died in 1936 when it was under the rule of the Nizam, and disputes as to succession arose between his legally married wife and two ladies, Mahboob Begum and Kadiran Begum, who claimed to be his wives. After protracted proceedings before several non judicial bodies a report adverse to the latter was made in January, 1950, but before the Nizam could issue a firman in accordance with it, Hyderabad became a part of the Indian Union and the Constitution of India came into force. An enactment called the Waliuddowla Succession Act, 1950, was therefore passed by the Hyderabad Legislature which provided that \" the claims of Mahboob Begum and Kadiran Begum and of their respective children to participate in the distribution of the matrooka of the late Nawab are hereby dismissed\" and that the above decision \"cannot be called in question in any court of law Held, that in singling out two groups of persons consisting of two ladies and their children out of those who claimed to be related to the late Nawab and preventing them from establishing their rights under the personal law which governed the community, in Courts of law, the Act was discriminatory ; that there was no rational or reasonable basis for the discrimination, and the Act contravened the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution and was therefore void. The analogy of private Acts of the British 405 Parliament is not helpful as the British Parliament enjoys legislative omnipotence and there are no constitutional limitations on its authority or power. \n",

By an order of the respondent dated March 9, 1962, the appellant 's services were terminated with effect from January 16, 1962 on the ground of long absence. After his representations and an appeal to higher authorities in the ;Corporation had been rejected, the appellant filed a petition for a writ of Certiorari to quash the dismissal order, but this petition was dismissed in limine.

On the other hand it was the respondents ' contention that though the order of dismissal referred to long absence as the cause of termination, the termination itself was not by way of punishment and the only right of the appellant under Regulation 61 was to two months ' notice in lieu of pay; and that an examination of the correspondence and the circumstances of the case showed that the appellant had been given to opportunity to show cause and that there was in fact and in substance compliance with the rules of natural justice.

The State of Maharashtra constituted a Municipality for certain villages including the Industrial Area. On representations made by the appellants and other manufacturers, the State proclaimed the exclusion of the Industrial Area from the Municipal Jurisdiction. The Municipality made representations to the State requesting that the proclamation, be withdrawn, agreeing to exempt the factories in the Industrial Area from payment of octroi for seven years from the date of the levy. The State acceeded to the request of the Municipality. The appellants claimed to expand their activities relying upon the Municipality 's assurance and undertaking. The Maharashtra Municipalities Act was enacted and the respondent Municipality took over the administration of the former municipality as its successor. Thereafter, the respondent Municipality sought to levy octroi duty on the appellant amounting to about Rs. 15 lakhs per annum. The appellants filed a petition under article 226 of the Constitution to restrain the respondent Municipality from enforcing the levy of the Octroi. The High Court dismissed the petition in limine. In appeal by special leave, HELD : The case must be remanded to the High Court for being readmitted to its file and dealt with and disposed of according to law. The High Court may, in exercise of its discretion, decline to exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution. But the discretion is judicial; if the petitioner makes a claim which is frivolous, vexatious, or prima facie unjust or which may not appropriately be true in a petition invoking extraordinary jurisdiction, the Court may decline to entertain the petition. But a party claiming to be aggrieved by the action of a public body or authority on the plea that the action is unlawful, highhanded, arbitrary or unjust is entitled to a hearing of its petition on the merits. Apparently the petition filed by the Company did not raise any complicated questions of fact for determination, and the claim could not be characterised as frivolous, vexatious or unjust. The High Court has given no reason for dismissing the petition in limine, and on a consideration of the averments in the petition and the materials placed before the Court the appellants were entitled to have its grievance against the action of the Municipality, which was prima facie unjust, tried. Merely because a question of fact is raised, the High Court will not be justified in requiring the party to seek relief by the somewhat lengthy, dilatory and expensive process by a civil suit against a public body. The questions of fact raised by the petition in this case are elementary. [858 C F] Public bodies are as much bound as private individuals to carry out representations or facts and promises made by them, relying on which 855 other persons have altered their position to their prejudice. The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a promise may be enforced ex contractu by a person who acts upon the promises when the law requires that a contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain form or be executed in the manner prescribed by statute and if the contract be not in that form the obligation may still be enforced against the body in appropriate cases, in equity. [859 D] If our nascent democracy is to thrive different standards \"of conduct ,for the people and the public bodies cannot ordinarily be permitted. A public body is not exempt from liability to carry out its obligation arising out of representations made by it relying upon which a citizen has altered his position to his prejudice. [860 D] There is undoubtedly a clear distinction between a representation of an existing fact and a representation that something will be done in future. The former may, if it amounts to a representation as to some fact alleged at the time to be actually in existence, raise an estoppel if another person alters his position relying upon that representation A representation that something will be done in future may result in a contract, if another person to whom it is addressed acts upon it. A representation that something will be done in future is not a representation that it is true when made. But between a representation of a fact which is untrue and a representation express or implied to do something in future there is no clear anti thesis. A representation that something will be done in future may involve an existing intention to act in future in the manner represented. If the representation is acted upon by another person it may, unless the statute governing the person making the representation provides otherwise, result in an agreement enforceable at law; if the statute requires that the agreement shall be in a certain form, no contract may result from the representation and acting thereupon but the law is not powerless to raise in appropriate cases an equity against him to compel performance of the obligation arising out of his representation.

The Government raised a preliminary objection the application being time barred. the reference was incompetent. The objection prevailed, both the District Court and the High Court. The appellant contended that while dealing with a reference under section 14(1) of the Hyderabad Act, the court cannot go into the question that the application was time barred under section 18(2) of the and Acquisition Act, 1894 and tbereby refuse to entertain the reference. Dismissing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: (1) The power of the Collector to make a reference under section 18 is circumscribed by the conditions laid down therein. These conditions are matters of substance and their observance is a condition precedent to the Collector 's power of reference. The fulfilment of these conditions, particularly the one regarding limitation are the conditions, subject to which the power of the Collector to make the reference exists. Therefore, the making of are application for reference within the time prescribed by proviso to section 18(2) is a sine qua non for a valid reference by the Collector.

            "Prediction: The appellant was an appellant in the erstwhile princely State of Hyderabad, known as Marathwada, which merged in the State of Bombay under the States Reorganisation Act, 1894. The Land Acquisition Officer, Aurangabad made an award directing payment of Rs. 1,318.11 P. inclusive of 15 per cent solatium as compensation to the appellant at the rate of 37 np. per sq. yard. The appellant instead of making an application for reference under section 14, sub section (1) of the Act filed an application before the Land Acquisition officer requesting him to revise the award stating further that in case it was not revised he would seek his remedy in a court of law '.

            "Target: The appellant contractor claimed a sum of Rs.3,87,796 before the sole arbitrator on April 5, 1977 for the value of 15 items of works not paid. To this he added interest to the tune of Rs.2, 95,894 at 18 per cent from the date which according to him each of the claims should have been set tled, making a total of Rs.6,83,690. He also prayed for further interest at 18 per cent from April 6, 1977 till date of award and thereafter until payment. The respondent State filed its written statement and the arbitration proceedings continued for some time. But before the arbitrator could make an award, an application under sections 8(2) and 12 of the Arbitration Act was filed before Subordinate Judge who by his order removed the arbitrator and appointed another person as the sole arbitrator. The new arbitrator entered on the reference, got all the records from the previous arbi trator and continued the hearing. The appellant made a supplemental claim for a sum of Rs.8,27,857 and also prayed for interest on that amount at 18 per cent from October 14, 1973 till date of payment. The respondent State objected to the entertainment of additional claim. The arbitrator, however, proceeded with the hearing. On November 8, 1981, the day the hearing was closed, the appellant contractor filed one consolidated 'abstract ' of his two claim state ments showing a total claim of Rs.31.44.437 and also prayed for interest at 18 per cent per annum from November 9, 1981 till the date of payment. The arbitrator made an award on December 7, 1981 allow ing a lump sum of Rs.25,00,156 together with interest at 9 per cent after the expiry of 30 days from the date of making the award, till the date of payment or decree whichever was earlier. The award was made a decree of the court. The court, however, disallowed interest from the date of decree till realisation. 349 On appeal by the respondent State the High Court came to the conclusion that the award was vitiated by non applica tion of mind amounting to legal misconduct. In that view, it set aside the award and remitted the matter back to the Arbitration Tribunal constituted under section 41A of the Arbi tration Act, as amended by Orissa Act 3 of 1983. Dismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1.1 Though the arbitrator is not bound to disclose as to what interpretation he has made and what inference he has derived from the documentary evidence, he is bound to refer in the award that he had considered all the documents placed before him, no matter whether he relies on them or discards them from consideration. [353A] 1.2 In the instant case, the arbitrator in his award ex facie did not mention that he had referred to or consid ered the documents placed before him in respect of the original claim. The order sheet mentions about the nearing on different dates relating to tile supplemental claim statement which was filed before him. It was this argument in respect of the supplemental claim that has been mentioned in the award. [353B] 2.1 The arbitrator in case of a reference to him in pursuance of an arbitration agreement between the parties, being a person chosen by parties is constituted as the sole and final judge of all the questions and the parties bind themselves as a rule to accept the award as final and con clusive. Even in a case where the arbitrator does not give any reason or he commits a mistake either in law or in fact in determining the matter referred to him and such a mistake does not appear on the face of the award, the same cannot be assailed. It could be interfered with only in limited cir cumstances as provided under sections 16 and 30 of the Act. The court has, therefore, to test the award with circumspection. 1354F, E, G] 2. 2 All the same, if the amount awarded is dispropor tionately high having regard to the original claim made and the totality of the circumstances, it would certainly be a case where the arbitrator could be said to have not applied his mind amounting to legal misconduct. [354G H] State of Orissa vs Dandasi Sahu, ; , referred to. In the instant case, in the original claim made before the arbitrator the value of the work not paid was stated as Rs.3,87,796. The supplemental claim made before the arbitrator amounted to 350 Rs.8,27,857. Thus, the total value of work not paid, accord ing to the appellant, was Rs.12,15,653. As against this claim, the arbitrator had awarded a lump sum of Rs.25,00,156. No doubt, the appellant had asked for payment of interest and including interest his claim was Rs.31,44,437. [354H; 355A] 2.3 Where a reference to arbitration was made prior to the commencement of the which came into force on August 19, 1981 the arbitrator is not empowered to grant interest for the period upto the date of submission of the claim or the period during which the dispute was pending before the arbitrator, and where the award granted a lump sum amount it shall deem to have included the interest also if interest had been claimed before the arbitrator and the inclusion of such interest would render that part of award invalid. [355B C] In the instant case, if the interest portion is exclud ed, then it becomes evident that award of Rs.25.00,156 suffers from the vice of giving disproportionately high amount. [355C D] 2.4 Since the award suffers not merely on the ground that it included interest but also on the ground of non application of the mind the question of setting aside only the invalid part relating to the grant of interest does not arise.

            "Prediction: The appellant contractor filed a claim on 16.6. 1975 before the Executive Engineer, M.I. Division, Berham pur, claiming to be paid a sum of Rs.2,81,745. He had also claimed interest on this at the rate of 18 per cent from the date of receiving of the claim book till payment. The State of Orissa filed a written statement and the arbitration proceedings continued for some time but before the arbitra tor could make the award an application before the Subordi nate Judge, Bhubaneswar was filed under sections 8(2) and 12 of the Arbitration Act. By an order dated 17.12.1979 the learned Subordinate Judge removed the arbitrator and ap pointed one Shri J.

            "Target: The disputes between the appellant company and its workmen were referred to the Industrial Tribunal. The workmen claimed that (1) they should be given cash allowance in lieu of the tiffin :arrangements made by the company, and (2) the practice started ,by the company of re employing retired persons should be discontinued. The Tribunal directed : (1) the clerical staff should be paid As. /8/ per day and the subordinate staff As. /6/ per day on all working days, and (2) the company should stop the reemployment of retired workmen in the category of clerks above C grade. In respect of the subordinate staff as also in regard to the lower grade clerks, the Tribunal thought it unnecessary to make any such direction. The evidence showed that in the region 31 comparable concerns were supplying free tiffin to their employees and that the appellant company had been throughout making .provision for tiffin to its employees. It was also found that the policy adopted by the company of re employing the retired personnel was not based solely on humanitarian grounds and that when retired persons were re employed they were paid a much smaller salary for doing the same work than they were drawing before retirement. 569 Held:(i) Though under the provisions of the Factories Act there was no obligation on the company, either statutory or otherwise, for giving the workers a cash allowance for tiffin, the history of the relations between the parties coupled with the prevailing practice in the comparable concerns showed that it was an implied condition of service that in addition to the wages and dearness allowance a provision for tiffin was an amenity to which the employees were entitled, and that the decision of the Tribunal could not be interfered with. (ii) The limited direction issued by the Tribunal in respect of the re employment of retired persons was neither improper nor unjustified. \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant, Mcleod & Company Ltd., and the respondents, its workmen, had an industrial dispute between the parties, one of the items in dispute being the claim made by the respondents in respect of tiffin on working days. In those proceedings, however, the said claim was not pressed and the matter was left to the appellant, either statutory or otherwise, for providing any further facility to the employees by way of giving them a cash allowance for tiffin. In the present dispute, the respondents contended that the tiffin arrangements made by them were unsatisfactory and they urged that the practice started by the appellant of re employing retired persons should be discontinued. The Tribunal has granted the first claim and has directed that the clerical staff should be paid As. /8/ per day and the subordinate staff As./6'per day on all working days in lieu of the tiff arrangements which are at present made.

            "Target: On a report given by the father, regarding the disappearance of his two daughters, investigation was taken up by the D.S.P. because of certain special circumstances. After completing the investigation, A 2, a sub inspector of police, A 1, his friend, and another were charged with offenses under sections 120B, 366, 376. 302/34, 201, 218, 468/34, and 324 I.P.C. for conspiracy, abduction, rape, murder, calling evidence of crime to disappear, fabricating reports, forgery and causing hurt. The trial court acquitted all the accused. On appeal by the State, the High Court convicted A.1 and A.2 for offences under sections 201, 218 and 468 I.P.C. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: (1) In order to bring home an offence under section 201, I.P.C., the prosecution has to prove; (a) that an offence has been committed; (b) that the accused knew or had reason to believe that the offence has been committed; (c) that with such knowledge or belief he, (1) caused any evidence of the commission of that offence to disappear, or, (ii) gave any information`respecting that offence which he then knew or believed to be false; (d) that he did so with the intention of screening the offender from legal punishment; and (e ) if the charge be of an aggravated form, as in the present case, that the offence in respect of which the accused caused evidence to disappear was punishable with death or with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment extending to 10 years. [610A E] Whether the circumstantial evidence in a particular case is sufficient and safe enough to warrant a finding that an offence has been committed, is a question which belongs to the realm of facts and not of law. So is the question whether the accused knew or had reason to believe that such an offence has been committed. [617H 618B] F Palvinder Kaur vs State of Punjab , explained. (2) In the present case the two girls died an unnatural death. The corpse of one was found on a beach having been washed ashore and the Corpse of the other was seen floating in the sea. A fisherman who noticed the second body saw marks indicating throttling. He removed a wrist watch and ornament, from it and allowed the body to drift away. The wrist watch and ornaments were identified as belonging to the younger sister of the first victim. The 3 possibilities are, that they committed suicide by drowning, or that their deaths were accidental, or that they were done to death by some person or persons. The choice of any of these possibilities would lead to the exclusion of the other two. [610G H] 3(a) The elder sister was a graduate and a nature girl of 22 who used to be the leader of the College Union. On the day of the occurrence the deceased girls along with their parents had participated in certain festivities. They were cheerful and there was no evidence to show that they were suffering from any mental depression with suicidal tendencies. [611E H] 603 (b) The body on the sea shore was in a semi nude condition. It had on only blouse, brassiere, petticoat and drawers but no sari. From the fact that it is customary for women of the locality to tie their series, tightly the possibility of the sari having been swept off be waves was remote. This shows that she was not wearing her sari when her body was immersed in water, but no Indian woman would commit suicide by jumping into sea in such a near nude condition because. ii would expose her body to post mortem. indignity. [611 H 162 C] (c) When the body was first seen there were, an injury on the forehead from which blood was oozing, a reddish abrasion on the thigh and blood marks on the drawers. the stomach, however, was not in a bloated condition. These circumstances show that death was not due to drowning. [612 G; E F] (4) It was nobody s case that any boat met with an accident off or near the sea shore resulting in loss of human life. No suggestion of accidental death of any person or woman was put to and prosecution witness. Such a plea had not ever been put forward by the accused in their statements recorded under s, 342, Cr. P.C. Therefore, the possibility of accidental death must also be excluded. [613 B D] (5) This process of elimination of suicide and accidental death inevitably leads to the conclusion that the death of these two girls, or at any rate of the first victim, was due to culpable homicide. [613 D] (6) From the very start, the investigation conducted by A. 2 was dishonest and fraudulent. He intentionally indulged in suppessio veri and suggestio falsi. [613 E F] (a) The morning after the night when the dead body was seen on the beach, a report was handed at the Police Station but the Head Constable returned it saying that it should be drawn up in the printed form and signed by the village Munsuff. A little later, A 2, the sub inspector incharge of the police station, came there and the Head Constable told him about the report. At that time A.1 and P. W. 49, also came to the Police Station, and A.1 also referred to the finding of the dead body on the seashore. Thereafter, A.1` A 2 and P.W. 49 and others went to the seashore at about noon. A 2 did not hold any inquest on the dead body, but instead, directed the body to be buried. When the Karnam questioned A 2 why he did not send the body for post mortem examination, A 2 replied that the body was that of a prostitute though the body was in an identifiable condition and he new the victim personally. He also said that it was a case of suicide and that P.W, 49 was a relation of the victim. A.1, who heard this, also said that P.W. 49 was a relation of the victim. Thereafter, A 2 fabricated an Inquest Report in which he stated falsely that there were no injuries on the dead body and that the stomach was bloated due to drinking of water, suggesting that it was a case of death by drowning. He also fabricated a false report as if given to him by one who knew the victim and the other girl to be prostitutes. That report was handed over by A 2 at the Police Station only 5 days later and he asked the Head Constable to note the date as if given 3 days before. The Head Constable did so after some hesitation. Inspire of persistent requests by the D.S.P., A.2 sent the copies of the F.I.R. and Inquest Report prepared by him only after an inordinate delay. A 2 also made false entries in the General Diary of the Police Station to corroborate the false Inquest Report and the fictitious complaint. He even tried to dissuaded the father from getting the body, which was buried, exhumed. [605 G 607 C; 614 G 616 E] (b) It was A 2 s duty to enter faithfully and truly the substance of the information in the station diary and to record further that he was proceeding for investigation on the basis thereof when he received information from the Head Constable about the reports regarding the finding of a dead body on the seashore. Instead of retrieving the written report that had been first received at the police station and returned by the head constable, he fabricated another document purporting to be the first information. All the reliable witnesses for the prosecution have deposed that no such person as the one who gave the first information was present at the scene of occurrence. When the D.S.P. was investigating into the matter, A 2 was not able to produce or give any indication about that informant though he claimed to have known him. Efforts to trace the existence of the two prostitutes mentioned in that report were also futile leading to the inference that they were also fictitious persons. [613 F 614 F] 604 The credible circumstantial evidence on record re inforced by the inference available from the incriminating conduct of the appellants, particularly A 2, in deliberately preparing false records to suppress the identity and the cause of death of the deceased girls fully justifies the conclusion reached by the High Court. [611 B C] (c) Section 174, Cr. P.C. peremptorily requires that the officer should hold an inquest on a dead body at the spot. This mandate is conveyed by the word there occurring in section 174(1). Section 174(3) gives a discretion to the Police officer not to sent the body for post mortem examination only in one case, namely, where there can be no doubt as to the cause of the death. This discretion has to be exercised prudently and honestly. [616 A C] (d) A 2 is a police officer of standing and experience, who was expected; to discharge the duties entrusted to him by law with fidelity and accuracy. He was required to ascertain the cause of death and investigate the circumstances and the efforts in which it was brought about. His duty was to make honest efforts to reach at the truth. He knew the deceased and saw the injuries on her dead body and must have known that in the circumstances of the case autopsy of the dead body was necessary to ascertain the cause or her death. He flouted all the salutary requirements of section 174. P.C. and his conduct in distoring and suppressing material evidence and preparing false records as to the identity of the dead body the cause of death and the falsification of the data bearing on that cause, could not be explained on any reasonable hypothesis save that of his guilt. [617 B E; 618 D F] (7) As regards A 1, his concerted conduct, including that in supporting the fraudulent misrepresentation made by A 2 to the Karnam. regarding PW 49 being a relation of the deceased, shows that he was a guilty associate of A 2. \n",

            "Target: Both under section 4(3)(xxi) of the Income tax Act, 1922 and section 10(26) of the Income tax Act, 1961, income of the members of a scheduled tribe included in article 366(25) of the Constitution and residing in any area specified in Part A or Part B of the Table appended to Paragraph 20 of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, excepting that of government servants, ' is exempt from income tax. The respondent was a member of such a scheduled tribe residing in such an area, but, as he was a government servant, he was assessed to income tax. He challenged the validity of the assessments and the High Court quashed the assessments holding that the two sections. to the extent they excluded government servants from the benefit of the exemption given thereunder, were discriminatory and therefore void. In appeal to this Court. HELD: The State has a wide discretion in selecting persons or objects it will tax, but within the range of selection made by it for the purpose of exemption, namely, among members of certain scheduled tribes residing in specified areas, the law as stated in the two sections. operates unequally and the inequality cannot be justified on the basis of any valid classification. [168H; 169B C] (1) The classification of trials into government servants and others cannot be justified on the basis of administrative convenience viz. that it was easy to collect taxes from government servants, because. their case does not stand on a different footing from that of the employees in statutory corporations or well established firms. [169F G] (2) There is no legislative practice or history treating government servants as a separate class for purposes of income tax. The reason for making, in the past, persons in the service of the government of British India serving outside British India subject to Indian income tax. is not t, hat their income was treated in a manner different from that of other salaried officers in those areas, but that the Indian Legislature had no legislative competence to tax residents of those areas but had competence to tax the income of persons in British Indian government service, serving in those areas. Further, the notification of 6th June 1890 under which the income earned by members of certain scheduled tribes, other than those in government service, was exempt from income tax, and the notification of 21st March 1922. under which income of certain indigenous hill men, other than those in government service. was exempt from tax, are not sufficient to prove a well established legislative practice. Those notifications were issued at a time when the power of the legislature to grant or withhold any exemption from tax was not subject to any constitutional limitation. Classification based on past legislative 166 practice and history does not mean that because in the past the legislature was enacting arbitrary laws it could do so now. [170A; 171D F] (3) The social status and economic resources of a government servant are not different from that of another holding a similar position in a corporation or that of a successful medical practitioner, lawyer, architect etc. Therefore, merely because a tribal becomes a government servant he is not lifted out of his social environment and assimilated into the forward sections of society. [172A B] (4) The portions of the two sections struck down are severable from the rest of the provisions in which they appear. [172E F] \n",

Shanti Lal Jain, respondent in the second appeal, was appointed as Compounder Grade I in the year 1959 and was holding the post of Sister Tutor in March 1966. In their separate petitions fried in the Rajasthan High Court, the respondents challenged the creation of two separate cadres Nursing Cadre and Compound ers Cadre under the Rules as arbitrary and as such viola tive of Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution of India. It was pleaded that hitherto there was combined channel of promotion for compounders and nurses but the Rules had arbitrarily deprived Compounders Grade I of their right to promotion to higher posts of Assistant Nursing Superintend ent and Nursing Superintendent Grade II/Grade I. It was further urged that recruitment to the Nursing Cadre was confined to females alone which resulted in discrimination on the ground of sex. The writ petitions were dismissed by the learned Single Judges who held that creation of two separate cadres was not arbitrary, did not infringe the equality clause, and was not discriminatory on the ground of sex. 'The Division Bench, on appeal, upheld the findings of the learned Single Judges on Article 5 but set aside their judgments and found that there was no justification for creating separate cadres and deny ing channel of promotion to Compounders Grade I to the higher posts in the Nursing Cadre.

Even assuming that prior to coming into force of the Rules there was a combined cadre of nurses and compounders, Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution do not forbid the State Government from creating new cadres, bifurcating one cadre into two or more, or uniting two or more cadres into one. The creation of cadres in the service of the State is a matter which has to be left entirely to the State Govern ment. [673G H] Reserve Bank of India vs N.C. Paliwal & Ors., ; ; referred to. A bare reading of the Rules show that the composition of the two cadres including designations, qualifications and methods of appointment to various posts, is entirely differ ent. This Court does not agree with the High Court that Nurses and Compounders belong to one class and as such must be encadred together. [678B] 4. It is not for the High Court to assume the extent of maternity cases which are treated in the hospitals or to lay down that compounders though not qualified to treat maternity cases must be equated with nurses because they can treat other type of cases. [678G] 5. By amending the Rules in 1978 an opening has been provided for compounders Grade II to enter the Nursing cadre by competing with the staff nurses for promotion to the post of Sister/Nursing Tutor. The Compounders Grade II have thus been provided with two channels of promotion, one in their own cadre and the other to the Nursing Cadre. Thus the grievance of the Compounders that they were denied channel of promotion to the higher posts in Nursing Cadre has also been removed. [679B C] \n",
            "Prediction: Bansi Lal Sharma was appointed as Male Nurse in 1941. He qualified Punjab Nursing Registration Council Examination in 1944 and was confirmed as Compounder Grade I in 1950. He was officiating as Sister Tutor when the Rajasthan Medical and Health Subordinate Service Rules, 1965 came into force in March, 1966. He filed writ petitions challenging the creation of two separate cadres under the Rules challenging the combined channel of promotion for compounders and nurses but the rules have arbitrarily deprived compounders Grade I of their right to promotion to the higher posts in the nursing cadre. The Bench held the Rules to be arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India and directed the State Government to consider the merits of the writ petitions. The Division Bench upheld the contentions of Sharma and held that there was no arbitrariness in creating two sepa rate cadres for nurses and compounders. The learned Judge further found as a fact that males and females were both eligible\n",

            "Target: The appellant Corporation engaged the respondents con tractors to carry out work of excavation, conversion of over head electric lines and laying of underground cables under public roads and for repair and maintenance. On 26.8.1975, the Regional Director of the Employees ' State Insurance Corporation noticed the appellant that the employees, whose wages were being paid through the respond ents contractors, would come under the provisions of Section 2(9) of the . 268 The appellant directed the representative body of the contractors respondents ' Association to comply with the provisions of the Act immediately, failing which a lumpsum of 7% would be deducted from their bills. When the respond ents ' Association refused to carry out such obligation, the appellant started to deduct the E.S.I. contribution amount at the rate of 10% from their bills from 1984 and continued deducting till 1985. The respondents contractors challenged the deductions from bills by filing a writ petition before the High Court, contending thai for carrying out their contracts, the re spondents were not supervised by the appellant, the princi pal employer and they were carrying out the allotted work under the contracts of sites outside the factory establish ment of the appellant and that the employees of the respond ents did not come within the definition of the term, 'em ployee ' under section 2(9) of the Act. On 23.3.1984, the Single Judge of the High Court passed an interim order permitting the appellant to respond to the notice issued by the E.S.I.C. and staying the realisation of the E.S.I. contribution from the respondent contractors. On 30.3.1985, under section 45 A of the Act, the Region al Director, E.S.I.C. held that the appellant was liable to pay the E.S.I. contribution in respect of the employees of its contractors and directed to pay the same. The appellant challenged that order under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by filing another writ petition. The Single Judge hearing both the writ petitions togeth er, dismissed them, holding that the ultimate supervision was that of the appellant and hence the Act was applicable. Following the decision of this Court in M.G. Beedi Works case (AIR 1974 SC 1952), the Single Judge further held that the respondents contractors were agents of the appellant the principal employer, and that the appellant the principal employer could not escape the liability for the works of its agents the respondents contractors. The Division Bench, in appeal, reversed the judgment of the Single Judge, against which the present appeals by special leave were made to this Court posing the question whether on the facts, the right of the principal employer to reject or accept work on 269 completion, on scrutinizing compliance with job require ments, as accomplished by a contractor, the immediate em ployer, through his employees, is in itself an effective and meaningful 'supervision ' as envisaged under section 2(9) of the E.S.I. Act, 1948?\" The appellants contended that the High Court fell in error in giving a restricted meaning to the word, 'supervi sion ', occurring in section 2(9) of the Act and in taking out the final act of rejection or acceptance of work from the purview of that word. Dismissing the appeals, this Court, HELD: Per Ranganath Misra, CJ. 1. The legislative intention should have been brought out more clearly by undertaking appropriate legislation once this Court took a different view. The legislation is benefi cial and if by interpretation put by the Court the intention is not properly brought out it becomes a matter for the legislature to attend to. [278 E] Per M.M. Punchhi. In whatever manner the word 'employee ' under Section 2(9) be construed, liberally or restrictidly, the construc tion cannot go to the extent of ruling out the function and role of the immediate employer or obliterating the distance between the principal employer and the immediate employer. In some situations he is the cut off. He is the one who stumbles in the way of direct nexus being established, unless statutorily fictioned, between the employee and the principal employer. He is the one who in a given situation is the principal employer to the employee, directly employed under him. If the work by the employee is conducted under the immediate gaze or overseeing of the principal employer, or his agent, subject to other conditions as envisaged being fulfilled, he would be an employee for the purpose of sec tion 2(9). [284 B D] 2. In the ordinary dictional sense \"to supervise\" means to direct or over see the performance or operation of an activity and to over see it, watch over and direct. It is work under eye and gaze of someone, who can immediately direct a corrective and tender advice. In the textual sense 'supervision ' of the principal employer or his agent is on 'work ' at the places envisaged and the word 'work ' can neither be construed so broadly to be the final act of 270 acceptance or rejection of work, nor so narrowly so as to be supervision at all times and at each and every step of the work. A harmonious construction alone would help carry out the purpose of the Act, which would mean moderating the two extremes. [284 G H] 3. When the employee is put to work under the eye and gaze of the principal employer, or his agent, where he can be watched secretly, accidently, or occasionally, while the work is in progress, so as to Scrutinise the quality thereof and to detect faults therein, as also put to timely remedial measures by directions given, finally leading to the satis factory,completion and acceptance of the work, that would be supervision for the purposes of Section 2(9) of the Act. It is the consistency of vigil, the proverbial 'a stich in time saves nine '. The standards of vigil would of course depend on the facts of each case. [284 H 285 B] 4. Section 182 of the defines \"agent\" as a person employed to do any act or to represent another in dealing with third persons, the person for whom such act is done, or is so represented is called the \"prin cipal\". Section 184 of the said Act further provides that as between Principal and the third person any person may become a, agent so as to be responsible to his principal. [288 E] 5. The agent has an identity distinct from his Princi pal in one sense and a fictional identity with his Principal in the other. The agreement nowhere amalgamates the identity of the electrical contractor with that of the principal (C.E.S.C.) by undertaking to provide adequate supervision for the purposes of the Act, on behalf of the C.E.S.C. The agreement no doubt provides that the electrical contractor would provide adequate supervision while carrying on with the work, the purpose dominant is to safeguard obtaining quality work and safety safeguards and to conform to the provisions of the Electricity Supply Act. [288 E G] 6. The creation or deduction of principal agent rela tionship throws one towards the statutory scheme of keeping distinct the concept of the principal and immediate employ er, because of diverse and distinct roles. [285 D] 7. The electrical contractor is obliged to provide competent supervision while carrying out the work. The electrical contractor 271 is otherwise a licensee under the Indian Electricity Act and the Rules made thereunder. [286 C] 8. The principal employer can not delegate the function of supervision to his agent who in the eye of law is his second self, i.e., a substitute of the principal employer. The immediate employer can by statutory compulsion never be the agent of the principal employer. If such a relationship is permitted to be established, it would, not only obliter ate the distinction between the two, but would violate the provisions of the Act as well as the contractual principle that a contractor and a contractee cannot be the same per son. [285 B C] 9. Checking of work after the same is completed and supervision of work while in progress is not the same. These have different perceptions. Checking of work on its comple tion is an activity, the purpose of which is to finally accept or reject the work, on the touchstone of job specifi cations. Thereafter if accepted, it has to be paid on the acceptance of the work. This step by no means is supervision exercised. It cannot be the terminating point of an agency when the interests of the so called principal and the so called agent become business like. [288 H 289 B] 10. Supervision rested with persons holding valid cer tificates of competency for which a register of supervision was required under the licence to be maintained. [289 C] 11. Under the contracts, the electrical contractors cannot in one breath be termed as agents of the C.E.S.C. undertaking supervision of the work of their employees and innately under the licence to have beforehand delegated that function to the holder of the certificate of competency. [289 C D] 12. Even if, the terms of the contract and the terms and conditions of the licence, the first being at the behest of the C.E.S.C. and the second being at the behest of the Government, be suggested to be complementing each other, still these cannot be so interplayed to mean that an agency, express or implied, has been created by the C.E.S.C. in favour of the electrical contractor appointing him to super vise work as envisaged under Section 2(9) of the Act, and thus to have established a direct link between the employee and the C.E.S.C. to the exclusion of the electrical contrac tor. [288 C D] 13. On the terms of the contract read with or without the terms of the licence, no such agency, factually or legally, stood ere 272 ated on behalf of the C.E.S.C. in favour of the electrical contractors, and none could be, as that would violate the statutory scheme of distinction well marked under Section 2(9) of the Act. The supervision taken was to fulfil a contractual obligation simplicitor. [289 D] 14. The employees of the electrical contractors, on the facts and circumstances do not come in the grip of the Act and thus all demands made towards ESI contribution made against the C.E.S.C. and the electrical contractors were invalid.

The seeks to serve the twin objects namely, social security, i.e., medi cal benefits in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury and other matters relating thereto and to augment the efficient performance of the duty. [289 H 290 A] 2. Section 2(9) of the Act encompasscs employees em ployed for wages in or in connection with the work of a factory or establishment to which the Act applies (i) who arc directly employed by the principal employer or (ii) employed by or through \"an immediate employer\"; and whose services are temporarily lent or let on hire to the princi pal employer by the person with whom the person is entered into a contract of service. [293 B C] 3. Clause 2(9)(ii) (applicable to the facts on hand) attracts a person employed by or through an immediate em ployer as an employee of the principal employer provided the f. flowing conditions are satisfied, namely, (1) the immedi ate employer employs an employee on the premises of the factory or establishment of the principal employer; (2) or \"under the supervision of the principal employer\". (3) \"his agent\" on work which is ordinarily part of the 273 work of the factory or establishment or which is preliminary to the work carried out in or incidental to the purpose of the factory or establishment. [293 C D] 4. Article 39(2) of the Constitution enjoins the State to direct its policies to secure the health and strength of workers. The right to social justice is a fundamental right. Right to livelihood springs from the right to life guaran teed under article 21. The health and strength of a worker is an integral facet of right to life. The aim of fundamental rights is to create an egalitarian society to free all citizens from coercion or restrictions by society and to make liberty available for all. Right to human dignity, development of personality, social protection, right to rest and leisure as fundamcntal human rights to common man mean nothing more than the status without means. To the tillers of the soil, wage earners, labourers, wood cutters, rickshaw pullers, scavengers and hut dwellers, the civil and politi cal rights are 'mere cosmetic\" rights. Socio economic and cultural rights are their means and relevant to them to realise the basic aspirations of meaningful right to life. [293 F H] 5. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Interna tional Conventions of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights rccognise their needs which include right to food, clothing, housing, education, right to work, leizure, fair wages, decent working conditions, social security, right to physi cal or mental health, protection of their families as inte gral part of the right to life. Our Constitution in the Preamble and Part IV reinforce them compendiously as social economic justice, a bed rock to an egalitarian social order. The right to social and economic justice is thus fundamental right. [293 H 294 B] 6. The term 'health ' implies more than an absence of sickness. Medical care and health facilities not only project against sickness but also ensures stable man power for economic development. Facilities of health and medical care generate devotion and dedication to give the workers ' best, physically as well as mentally in productivity. It enables the worker to enjoy the fruit of his labour, to keep him physically fit and mentally alert for leading a success ful, economic, social and cultural life. The medical facili ties, arc thcrefore, part of social security and like gilt edged security, it would yield immediate return in the increased production or at any rate reduce absenteeism on grounds of sickness, etc. health is thus a state of complete physical, menial and social well being and nut merely the absence of disease or infirmity. [294 E G] 274 7. Right to health is a fundamental human right to workmen. The maintenance of health is a most imperative constitutional goal whose realisation requires interaction by many social and economic factors. Just and favourable condition of work implies to ensure safe and healthy working conditions to the workmen. The periodical medical treatment invigorates the health of the workmen and harnesses their human resources. Prevention of occupational disabilities generates devotion and dedication to duty and enthuse the workmen to render efficient service which is a valuable asset for greater productivity to the employer and national production to the State. [294 H 29S B] 8.The aims at relieving the employees from health and occupational hazards. The interpretation calls for in this case is of the meaning of the meanings 'supervision ' and 'agent ' in s.2(9)(ii) of the Act. The legal interpretation is not an activity sui gener is. The purpose of the enactment is the touch stone of interpretation and every effort would be to give effect to it. The judge acts as a vehicle of communication between the authors and the recipients. The end result is to promote rule of law and to enliven social order and humane rela tions. [295 C D] 9. In an attempt to construe the provisions of the statute, construction, as a balancing wheel, should be meaningful so as to make the statute workable and not to render it futile or sterile. Whenever strict interpretation of the statute gives rise to unjust situation or results, the Judges can ensure their good sense to remedy it by reading words in, if necessary, so as to do what Parliament would have done had they had the situation in mind. The meaning of the same words in a statute may be mended in the laborynth of interpretation and may be enlarged or restrict ed in order to harmonise them with the legislative intention of the entire statute. The spirit of the statute would prevail over the literal meaning. The jurisprudence and principle, therefore, in such a situation, would be the contextual interpretation to subserve the constitutional scheme and to alongate the legislative purpose, harmonising the individual interest with the community good so as to effectuate social transformation envisioned in the preamble of the Constitution. [297 D F] 10. The word \"supervision\" is not one of precise import and is broad enough to require either supervisor 's constant presence during work supervised or his devotion thereto if only time necessary to see that it complies with contract specifications, advise as to details, prepare necessary sketches and drawings, etc. [298 C] 275 11. The does not give its own definition of the word \"supervision\". Therefore, it must be construed in the context the ultimate purpose the Act aims to serve and the object behind the Act, i.e. to extend sickness benefits and to relieve the employee from occupa tional hazards consistent with the constitutional and human rights scheme. Under the Electricity Act and the Rules, the Corporation, licencee, is enjoined to perform the acts and duties contemplated thereunder to lay overhead lines, under ground cables, their repairs and maintenance there of, etc. It authorised, under the contract, the immediate employer to perform, on its behalf, those acts and duties. The immediate employer would get the work done through their employees employed for that purpose. It is not a sporadic work but a constant and an ongoing process, so long as the licencee generates, transmits and supplies electrical energy to the consumers of their supply area. Had the principal employer performed those acts and duties through its employees, indisputably, their employees would be covered under the Act, though the work was got done at highways or at places other than the factory or the establishment. When the prin cipal employer authorises the respondents as its contractors under contracts the need for constant supervision is obviat ed relegating that function to its immediate employers. Otherwise the need for contracts would be redundant. The Corporation retained, under the contract, the power of acceptance or rejection of the work done or supervision effected in maintenance of the work got done by the immedi ate employer, subject to overall supervision by the Electri cal Inspector, on behalf of the State Government. The super vision in the fact situation is not the day to day supervi sion but legal control, i.e. right to accept or reject the work done or maintenance effected. The exercise of right of acceptance or rejection is the supervision as envisaged in the contract between the principal employer and the immedi ate employer. It would supply the needed unifying or con necting thread between the constitutional creed of social justice i.e., social security under the Act and supervision of the acts or duties by the principal employer vis a vis the employees of the immediate employer under the contract who ultimately perform them on behalf of the principal employer. Undoubtedly in a bilateral contract between the corporation and the respondents qua their rights and liabil ities under the contracts, strict interpretation of the words cngrafted therein, be of paramount relevance and call for attention as per Contract Act. [301 C 302 B] 12. In the context of the statutory interpretation of \"supervision\" under the Act of the works undertaken under the contract, the 276 interest of the workmen or the welfare schemes for the employees under the Act interposed and call attention to and need primacy. In its construction the courts must adopt contextual approach to effectuate the statutory animation, namely, social security. The literal interpretation would feed injustice in perpetuity denying to the employees of sickness benefit etc. under the Act, which would be avoided, lest the purpose of the Act would be frustrated. [302 B C] 13. The application of the golden rule to the word \"agency\" under the between the respond ents and the corporation, perhaps, does not encompass agency in strict sense under the Act. But public policy of the Act, the constitutional and human right 's philosophy to provide social security to protect the health and strength of the workers must be kept at the back of the mind to construe the word \"agent\" under section 2 (9) (ii) of the Act, in contradis tinction with the bilateral stipulations under the contract. In this regard public policy interposes and plays a vital role to read into the contracts the extended meaning of agency to bring about connecting links between the respond ents and the licencee corporation. Lest the contract, if intended to deny welfare benefits to workmen, would be opposed to public ' policy and would become void under section 23 of the . Such an intention would be avoided by reading into the contract the extended meaning of agency but not fiduciary. [302 E G] 14. The contractors, respondents, knew at the date of the agreements that the Corporation, as principal employer, is under statutory obligation to execute or keep executed the works and keep them repaired and maintained as an inte gral activity of generation, transmission and distribution of the electrical energy to the consumers within their area of supply. On authorisation, the respondents execute and keep executed the works and repairs or kept them repaired and the maintenance thereof effected through their employ ees, which in law is on behalf of the Corporation, principal employer. The genesis and aim of the transaction was to act on behalf of the Corporation. The agency of the respondent with the Corporation, thus, springs into being. The prohibi tion of the qualified supervisors, while in service of the respondents, to disengage themselves with third parties in terms of the contract was only to extract unstinted and exclusive devotion to duty and no further. It stands no impediment to construe that/he respondents are agents to the Corporation as immediate employers. [303 F H] 277 15. The employees working under the respondents perform their duties in execution of the works, repairs and mainte nance thereof in connection with the generation, transmis sion and distribution of the electrical energy by the Corpo ration licensee. The Corporation is the principal employer. The respondents ' immediate employers execute the work etc. under the supervision of the Corporation as its agents. Their employees, in law, work under the supervision of the principal employer, corporation. They are covered under s.2(9) (ii) of the Act entitling to the sickness benefits, etc. envisaged therein and the respondents are liable to make their contribution to the Employees ' Insurance Fund.

            "Target: Misconduct was imputed to the appellant by his employer, the second respondent. The then Secretary of the bank enquired into the allegations and, after issuing a notice to the appellant for showing cause against punishment, accepted his explanation and dropped the proceedings. Thereafter, the Managing Director of the Bank opined that the said Secretary was not empowered to punish a bank employee, and therefore, the proceedings culminating in the exoneration of the appellant were invalid. The proceedings were revived, and the appellant was suspended. His writ petition under articles 226 and 227 was dismissed by the High Court. On appeal by special leave, the appellant challenged the revival of the proceedings against him, as illegal and opposed to natural justice. Dismissing the appeal, the Court. ^ HELD: (1) There is no present grievance of punitive action which can be ventilated in court. The writ petition is premature since no action has been taken finally, against the appellant. [687A] (2) The co operative bank has not been able to show any power to suspend an employee pending an enquiry. If that be so, the suspension of the appellant is plainly without the pale of law.

            "Prediction: The appellant was an employee of the second respondent. A notice was issued to him to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him for certain items of misconduct imputed to him.

            "Target: Section 13(1)(f) of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956 Act XII of 1956) enacted that no order or decree for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be made by any court in favour of the landlord against the tenants except among others, on the ground that the premises are reasonably required by the landlord either for the purpose of building or rebuilding or for making thereto substantial additions or alterations or for his own occupation if he is the owner or for the occupation of any person for whose benefit the premises are held. Section 13(4) of the Act provides that where a landlord requires the premises on any of the grounds mentioned in cl. (1)(f) and the Court is of opinion that such requirement may be substantially satisfied by ejecting the tenant from a part only of the premises the Court shall pass a decree accordingly. In 1969 the Act was amended by West Bengal Premises Tenancy (Second Amendment) Act. Section 13 of the original Act was amended by introducing sub section (3A) in it. This sub section prohibits institution of a suit for ejectment of a tenant by a landlord who has purchased the premises for his own use within three years of the purchase. The Amending Act also enacted that the said Act shall apply to suits and appeals, which are pending at the date of the commencement of the Act. The respondent purchased the suit premises in which the appellant was a tenant and instituted a suit for ejectment of the tenant under s.13(1)(f) of the original Act. The suit was decreed by the lower court and affirmed by the lower appellate court. A single Judge of the High Court dismissed the appeal. When the Letters Patent Appeal was pending before the High Court, the Amending Act of 1969 was passed, whereupon, the tenant appellant invoked the provisions of the new sub sec. (3A) and contended that since the landlord had instituted a suit the ejectment within three years of the purchase, the suit should be dismissed. The High Court held that s.3A was valid prospectively but that the restriction imposed by the sub section. giving it retrospective effect, was violative of article 1(1) (f) of the Constitution. Per Beg and Krishna Iyer, JJ: Allowing the appeals and remitting the case to the High Court, HELD : (1) (a) There is no violation of article 19(1) (f) read with article 19(5) of the Constitution in the Amending Act, and s.13 of the original Act, as amended is valid. The evil corrected by the Amendment Act is to stop the influx of a transferee class of evictors of tenants and institution of litigation to eject and rack rent or re build to make large profits. Apparently the inflow of such suits must have been swelling slowly over the years and when the stream became a flood the Legislature rushed with an amending bill. Had it made the law merely prospective, those who had, in numbers, already gone to Court and induced legislative attention would have escaped the inhibition. This would defeat the object and so the application of the additional ban to Pending actions could not be called unreasonable. There is no foundation for the assumptions made by the High Court that there may be cases of ejectment instituted prior to 1956 or that a number of suits and decrees, perhaps decades old. will unjustly be nullified by the previous operation of the new ban. Recondite instances and casual hardships cannot deflect constitutional construction of social legislation, 775 if the main thrust of the statute relates to a real social evil of dimensions deserving to be antidoted by antedated legislative remedy. Questions such as whether those cases which were filed several years ago should have been carved out of the category of transferees hit by the Act, and at what point of time the evil assumed proportions were best left to legislative wisdom and not to courts commonsense. [788C D; 787F G; 783F; 787H] In the instant case the two landlord respondents had purchased the buildings in the early sixties, but while considering the constitutionality the Court would not be moved by such accidental instances. The substantial evil has been substantially met by a broad application of the new ban to pending proceedings. [788C] Section 13. fairly read, directs that the amendment made by section 4 shall have effect in respect of suits, including appeals, pending at the commencement of the Act. The Court is, therefore, bound to give effect to section 4 in pending actions regardless of isolated anomalies and individual hardships. [788G] (b)Where two interpretations are possible that which validates the statute and shortens litigation should be preferred to the one which invalidates or proliferates it. Although the old cl. (f) is substantially similar to the present cls.(f) and (ff) the latter imposes more severe restrictions protecting the tenants. Much more has to be proved by the landlord now before he can get eviction than when he was called upon to under the earlier corresponding provision of the basic Act. Moreover, the three year prohibition against institution of the suit is altogether new. It follows, therefore, that on the present allegation and evidence the landlord may not get a decree, his suit having been instituted at a; time when he could not have foreseen the subsequent enactment saddling him with new conditions. [789C; 789B] Though therefore, the suit, as originally brought in, would be defective since it did not and could not contain the averments complying with the new cls. (f) and (ff) of section 13(1) it is made effective by construing the term 'institute ' in a natural and grammatical way. [789D] (c) 'To institute is 'to begin or commence '. The prohibition clamped down by sub section (3A), carefully read, is on suits for recovery of possession by transferee landlords on any of the grounds mentioned in cl. (f) Qr cl. (ff) of sub section (1). [789G] In the instant case the suits were not for recovery on grounds contained in clauses (f) and (ff). They were based on the repealed cl.(f) of s.13 of the basic Act. Strictly speaking sub section (3A) brought in by section 4 of the Amending Act applies only if (a) the suit is by a transferee landlord; (b) it is for recovery of possession of premises; and (c) the ground for recovery is what is mentioned in cls. (f) and (ff) of sub section (1). Undoubtedly the third condition is not fulfilled and therefore sub section (3A) is not attracted. [789H] (d)But since the new cls.(f) and (ff) were included by the Amendment Act in s.13 of the basic Act and since the suits did not seek eviction on those grounds they will have to be dismissed on account of the omnibus inhibition on recovery of possession contained in section 13 itself. [790C] Per Goswami, J : (1)(a) In trying to include old actions that may be surviving in courts because of laws ' proverbial delay section 13 of the Amended Act has gone far in excess of the actual needs of the time and problems and the provisions therefore cannot be said to impose a reasonable restriction on the right of the transferee landlords, albeit a well defined class amongst the landlords, to hold and enjoy their property in the interest of the general public. Such transferee landlords with pending old actions in suits or in appeals are not likely to be of a large number. The imposition of such restrictions on a few transferee landlords cannot be in the general interests of the large body of tenants. If relief in the shape of postponement of the landlord 's suit were the object of sub section (3A) in giving retrospectivity to it. the law did not take count of the inevitable long 776 delay that takes place in pending litigation as a result of man made laws of procedure in courts such as have been clearly demonstrated by the cases at hand. The lawthat misses its object cannot justify its existence. Besides it will be a sterilerelief if tenants have to face a fresh summons next days. [798A C] (b)Under the Constitution an individual 's right will have to yield to the commonweal of the general community, That general community may be in broad segments but even then must form a class as a whole. A few individuals cannot take the Place of a class and for the matter of that the general public. [798H] In the present case the relief contemplated by the Amendment Act is in favour of tenants in general and the restriction under sub section (3A) must be viewed in that context. It cannot be said that the legislature in applying sub section (3A) retrospectively has achieved that avowed object at all. The applicability of the blanket ban to pending suits and appeals cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction in ,he interest of general public. [799A B] (c)Sub section (3A) so far as it is retrospective and as such applicable to pending suits including appeals is ultra vires article 19(1) (f) of the Constitution. The provision is valid only prospectively. The retrospectivity so far as subsection (3A) in concerned with regard to institution of suits made applicable to pending suits and appeals is clearly very wide of a reasonable mark and is an imposition of an unreasonable restriction on the right of the transferee landlords in pending suits which had been instituted prior to the amendment Act and in appeals arising therefrom and it is not saved by the protective clause (5) of article 19 of the Constitution. [799D E] (2)On the terms of only section 13 (3A) it is difficult to hold that it would bring old actions within the mischief of section 13(3A) which imposes a ban expressly on institution of suits within three years of the acquisition of ownership of the premises subject to the relaxation contained in the proviso thereto. [796B C] (3)Section 13(1)(f) and (ff) are not ultra vires of article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. Further reliefs have been sought to be given to the tenants as a class by these provisions in the Amendment Act. These further reliefs are in the general interests of tenants and can be applied without any difficulty, to pending suits including appeals. There is nothing unreasonable about such a retrospectivity in applying these provisions for the general welfare of tenants in securing for them asafe and sure tenure as far as practicable untrammelled by inconvenient litigation.[799F G] Arguments for theappellants In C.A. 2063/73 by P. C. Chatterjee There is no vestedright to eject on determination of the tenancy but it is conditioned by section 13, Cl. (a) to (k) and therefore right to eject is not vested in the landlord until a decree is passed. Upto that stage it is contingent depen ding on the satisfaction of cl. (a) to (k) of s.13. If there is no vested property right, no question of article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution will arise. By denying the right to eject for three years from the date of purchase the right to property is not restricted or burdened. The approach of the High Court of separately treating prospectivity and retrospectivity is not correct. The correct approach adopted by this Court is that in considering the reasonableness of any provision retrospectivity of the law is a factor to be considered. Retrospective operation is not bad because it covers a period of 10 years or so. For respondent (In C.A. 1304 of 1973.) The object of the new sub section (3A) being to give protection to tenants for a limited period of three years from the date of purchase of the premises by the landlord, by giving retrospective effect to ' the said sub section the period limited by the subsection cannot be enlarged. Therefore, s.13 of the Amending Act which gives retrospective effect to the said sub section (3A) should be construed in a manner so as to keep the effect of retrospectively within the period 777 limited by the said new sub section 3A. Sections 4 and 13 of the Amending Act have to be construed harmoniously keeping the object of the Act in view and in doing that if the court has to supply some words to make the meaning clear, it should prefer the construction which is more in consonance with reason and justice. at 745. The language of sub section 3A and the object and reason for introduction of the said sub section make it clear that Only Prospective effect could be given to the sub section and in any case its effect cannot go beyond three years of purchase of the premises by the landlord. If, s.13 of the Amending Act means that section 4 of the Amending Act applies to all pending suits including appeals filed by a transferee landlord after the principal Act came into force, then it is clearly violative of art 19(1)(f) of the Constitution. The High Court therefore, rightly struck down s.13 giving retrospective effect to section 4 of the , Act. Further no law can impose restrictions retrospectively on fundamental rights. Arguments for the respondent in C.A. No. 2063 of 1973. The impugned section cannot be so interpreted as to give it retrospective effect so as to bring within its mischief all suits and proceedings including appeals which may be pending since the enforcement of the Act. This Court can depart from the general rule to apply the law as it is on the date of institution of the suit and apply the law as on the date when the appeal comes up for disposal specially because no injustice is going to be caused between the parties and as such a course would avoid multiplicity of proceedings. Section 13 of the Amending Act is ultra vires of article 19, because, construed literally the section cannot give protection to such of the tenants against whom proceedings are pending for more than 10 years or so, a protection for a period more than what is envisaged by the Amending Act. This is clearly not what is intended or contemplated by the legislature. Giving retrospective effect to the section would only benefit a few and is not in the public interest of the tenants of the transferee landlords. The restriction is arbitrary and invades the right to property and is not saved by cl. (5) of article 19. The restriction is not reasonable. \n",
            "Prediction: The landlord proprietariat's right of eviction was challenged in the Calcutta High Court by a Single Judge of the High Court following a Division Bench ruling of the same Court. The appellants appealed to this Court, challenging the constitutionality of legislation handcuffing the landlord proprietor's rights of eviction. The High Court held that the provisions of the West Bengal Rent Control Act, 1969, were retroactive to a 1969 legislative amendment implanting additional restrictions on eviction of premises under the earlier West Bengal rent control law. The aggrieved tenant in each case has appealed and the State, not being directly a party to the legislation, has entered appearance to support, the legislation and to challenge the Cal cutta decision to the extent it has invalidated the retrospective part of the statute. In the appeal before this Court it was contended that judicial conscience is not a mere matter of citations of precedents but of activist appraisal of social tears to wipe out which the State is obligated under the Constitution\n",

            "Target: Jagannathdas and his wife Premwati had no children. Premwati suffered from tuberculosis and died on September 24, 1951. Thereafter Jagannathdas created a trust in respect of his estate which comprised of properties falling to his share in a family partition. The appellant filed a suit claiming that he had been adopted by Jagannathdas and Premwati as their son on September 24,1951, that the trust was void and that he was entitled to a half share in the estate. The trial court decreed the suit after finding that the appellant had in fact been adopted by Jagannathdas and Premwati and that the adoption was valid. On appeal by the trustees the High Court reversed the finding of tho trial court taking a different view of the evidence on record and dismissed the suit. Allowing the appeal against the order of the High Court, ^ HELD: In an appeal against a trial court decree, when the appellate court considers an issue turning on oral evidence it must bear in mind that it does not enjoy the advantage which the trial court had in having the witnesses before it and of observing the manner in which they gave their testimony. When there is a conflict of oral evidence on any matter in issue and its resolution turns upon the credibility of the witnesses, the general rule is that the appellate court should permit the findings of fact rendered by the trial court to prevail unless it clearly appears that some special feature about the evidence of a particular witness has escaped the notice of the trial court or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to displace its opinion as to where the credibility lies. The principle is one of practice and governs tho weight to be given to a finding of fact by the trial court. 852 There is, of course, no doubt that as a matter of law if the appraisal of the evidence by the trial court suffers from a material irregularity or is based on inadmissible evidence or on a misreading of the evidence or on conjectures and surmises the appellate court is entitled to interfere with the finding of fact. [856 D E; 857 B C] W.C. Macdonald vs Fred Latimer, A.I.R. 1929 P.C. 15; Watt vs Thomas, ; Sara Veeraswami alias Sara Veerraju v Talluri Narayya (deceased) and Ors. A.I.R. ; Sarju Parshad vs Raja Jwaleshwari Pratap Narain Singh and Ors. , ; ; and The Asiatic Steam Navigation Co. Ltd vs Sub Lt. Arabinda Chakravarti, [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 979 referred to. In the instant case the question whether the appellant had in fact been adopted by Jagannathdas and Premwati had been determined by the trial court essentially on tho basis of oral testimony and reference had been made to a few documents only in supplementation of the oral evidence. The judgment of the trial court showed that it had analysed tho testimony of each material witness and in reaching its conclusions on the issues of fact it had relied in some instances upon its own appraisal of the manner in which the witnesses present before it had rendered their testimony and had weighed with great care the probative value of the evidence in the context of established fact and probability. But the High Court had, in disagreeing with the trial court, adopted an erroneous approach. It proceeded to judge the credibility of the witnesses mainly with reference to their relationship with the parties without placing adequate weight on the nature of the evidence and the probability of its truth in the context of the surrounding circumstances. It rejected the testimony of the appellant 's witnesses substantially on the ground that they were related to the appellant. This cannot, by itself constitute a sufficient basis for discrediting the witnesses. When a witness holds a position of relationship favouring the party producing him or of possible prejudice against ' the contesting party, it is incumbent on the court to exercise appropriate caution when appraising his evidence and to examine its probative value with reference to the entire mosaic of facts appearing from the record. It is not open to the court to reject the evidence without anything more on the mere ground of relationship or favour of possible prejudice. The High Court should also have reminded itself that the witnesses had given their evidence before the trial court which had the opportunity of seeing their demeanour in the witness box and tho appreciation of their evidence by the trial court bad to be given due consideration in the light of that fact. [856C; 857 D; 861 E G; 862 A B] (b) It is well settled that a person who seeks to displace the natural ' succession to property by alleging an adoption must discharge the burden that lies upon him by proof of the factum of adoption ar d its validity. It is also true that the evidence in proof of the adoption should be free from all suspicion of fraud and so consistent and probable as to give no occasion for doubting its truth. Nontheless the fact of adoption must be proved in tho same way as any other fact. [862 C D] A. Ragavamma and Anr. vs A. Chanchamma and Anr. A.I.R. and. Kishori Lal vs Chaltibai [1959] Supp. 1 S.C.R. 698 referred to. 853 (c) For a valid adoption the physical act of giving and taking is an essential requisite, a ceremony imperative in all adoptions, whatever the caste. And this requisite is satisfied in its essence only by the actual delivery and acceptance of the boy, even though there exists an expression of consent or an executed deed of adoption. In some cases to complete the adoption a \"datta homam\" has been considered necessary but in the case of the twice born classes no such ceremony is needed if the adopted boy belongs to the same gotra as the adoptive father. [862 E; 863 B] Shoshinath v Krishnasunder (1881) L.R. 7 I.A. 250; Lakshman Singh v Smt. Rupkanwar ; and Bal Gangadhar Tilak vs Shrinivas Pandit (1915) L.R. 42 I.A. 135 referred to. In the instant case the High Court, relying on certain observations made by the Privy Council in Susroogan v Sabitra, held that the trial court had not scrutinised the evidence relating to the performance of the ceremony of giving and talking and also did not have due regard to the probabilities and, on that basis, proceeded to reappraise the evidence in elaborate detail. When the Privy Council made those observations it had in mind cases where it was possible no doubt to make the acknowledgements, observe the ceremonies and give the notices adverted to by it. The High Court applied that standard to a case which was quite different. The issue here was whether the adoption had been effected in circumstances which plainly did not permit time for making acknowledgements, observing elaborate ceremonies and giving notices generally. According to both the parties, Premwati was seriously ill. The appellant 's case is that she was so ill that she wanted to effect the adoption that very day. The respondents have alleged that she was already incapable of any activity. It is inconceivable that any elaborate arrangements for adoption could have been envisaged. In consequence, the High Court misdirected itself in applying a standard of proof to the evidence which the circumstances did not warrant. Even upon the approach adopted by the High Court its findings are vitiated by its failure to consider material evidence on record and by its reaching conclusions not sustainable in reason. The appellant has pleaded the custom of his community that the act of giving and taking suffices to effect a valid adoption and nothing has been shown to indicate that the further ceremony of 'datta homam ' was necessary [863 D H; 864 A D; 864 F; 863 B] Sutroogan vs Sabitra, referred to (d) Separation from a Joint Hindu Family is effected by a clear and unequivocal intimation on the part of a member of the Family to his co sharers of his desire to sever himself from the Family. A mere uncommunicated declaration amounts to no more than merely harbouring an intention to separate. A valid ' partition requires notice to the co sharers of the intention to separate.

Ranganna and Ors. ; and Kalyani (dead) by L. Rs. vs Narayanan and Ors. , ; referred to. 854 In the instant case the trust deed contained a declaration on the part of Jagannathdas of his intention to separate in the event of the adoption deed being found valid by the court but no notice of such intention was given nor could be inferred from Jagannathdas to the appellant. Both the trial court and the High Court rightly rejected the contention that the declaration in the trust deed must R be regarded as effecting partition. [869 E; 869 A] \n",

A family arrangement by which the property is equitably divided between the various contenders so as to achieve an equal distribution of wealth, instead of concentrating tho same in the hands of a few, is a milestone in the ad ministration of social justice. Where by consent of the parties a matter has been settled, the courts have learned in favour of upholding such a family arrangement instead of disturbing it on technical or trivial grounds. Where the courts find that the family arrangement suffers from a legal lacuna or 1 formal defect, the rule of estoppel is applied to shut out the plea of the person who being a party to the family arrangement, seeks to unsettle a settled dispute and claims to revoke the family arrangement under which he has himself enjoyed some material benefits. 1208 F H; 209 A B] (B) (1) The family settled must be bona fide so as to resolve family disputes.

The plaintiffs thus ceased to have any interest in this patni and remained in possession of the lands in the status of occupancy ryaots or undertenure holders\n",

            "Target: This appeal concerns whether an English court has jurisdiction to determine the future level of contact between a child and his mother where the child does not habitually reside in an EU Member State. Under article 12.3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (Brussels II Revised) parties are able to opt in to the jurisdiction of an EU court which would not otherwise have jurisdiction to determine a childs future. This applies where: (a) the child has a substantial connection with that Member State; and (b) the jurisdiction of the courts has been expressly accepted or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised, and the exercise of jurisdiction is in the best interests of the child. In this case the child had been resident in Pakistan since 2004, although both he and his divorced parents are British citizens and his parents live here. Both the High Court and the Court of Appeal held that an English court had no jurisdiction. The mother appealed. The Supreme Court had two issues to decide: firstly, whether article 12 extended to cases where a child lived in a non EU member state; and secondly, if it did, whether the parties in this case had accepted jurisdiction in accordance with the criteria set out in article 12.3(b). The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and declares that the courts of England and Wales have jurisdiction in this case. The Supreme Court holds that article 12 of Brussels II Revised applies to a child who is lawfully resident outside the European Union. In this case it was clear that the criteria of article 12.3 were satisfied and therefore that the parties had opted in to this jurisdiction. Lady Hale gave the leading judgment. There was a difference of opinion between the Justices on the precise meaning of article 12.3(b) but it was not necessary to decide this issue in order to decide the case.(Paragraphs [17], [35], [45]) On the first issue, if parents opt in to the jurisdiction of an EU court under article 12.3, that court can exercise jurisdiction even if the child does not lawfully reside within the territory of a an EU Member State. Lady Hale reached this conclusion using ordinary principles of construction, concluding that nothing in article 12 limits jurisdiction to children who reside in an EU Member State. This was confirmed by the conclusion that the term third State in other parts of the Regulation (notably articles 12.4 and 61) means a state outside the EU. This is supported by the Practice Guide to the Regulation, as well as other sources emanating from the EU. [17] [20] The Pakistan Protocol (referred to by the Court of Appeal), in which the judiciaries of Pakistan and England agreed it will generally be best for jurisdiction to be exercised in the country of the childs habitual residence, was not directly applicable. In any event such an agreement between judges could not affect the proper interpretation of Brussels II Revised. [41] [44] On the second issue, the criteria under article 12.3 were clearly satisfied in this case. Firstly, under 12.3(a), the substantial connection was satisfied by the fact the childs parents are habitually resident in the UK and they and the child are British citizens. [21] Secondly, jurisdiction had been expressly and unequivocally accepted by the parties under 12.3(b), both before and after proceedings commenced. In particular, the father had accepted jurisdiction by undertaking to bring the child back here if required to do so by the Court. [33] [34] Finally, the exercise of jurisdiction was in the best interests of the child given the presumption in article 12.4 that where a child is resident in certain non EU States it will be in his best interests for jurisdiction to be exercised under this article. It was also relevant that the childs guardian in the High Court considered that the childs future was best decided in this country. [37] [38] The Justices expressed different views on the meaning of the words in article 12.3(b) requiring express or unequivocal acceptance by all of the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised. Did this mean before, when or after the relevant proceedings were begun? It was also unclear whether these words describe the time at which parties have accepted jurisdiction or, as argued on behalf of the interveners Reunite, describe the parties whose acceptance is required. The Justices do not express a concluded view as it was not necessary to do so in order to decide this appeal. In this case all the parties had given unequivocal acceptance both before and after the proceedings had begun. The diversity of views indicates that the interpretation is not acte clair and if a case arises where the issue has to be decided it may have to be the subject of a reference to the European Court of Justice under articles 68 and 234 of the EC Treaty.

            "Prediction: The first and principal question before us is whether the parties right of prorogation, to opt in to the jurisdiction of an EU country which would not otherwise have jurisdiction to determine a childs future, contained in article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 (Brussels II Revised), can apply to a child who is habitually resident outside the European Union. If the answer to that question is yes, then the second question is whether that is what has happened in this case. That depends both upon the interpretation of the criteria for opting in and upon an evaluation of what these parties did. The first question is a good deal easier to answer than the second. The facts The child in question was born on 27 July 2000 and is now aged nine. He was taken to hospital on 1 November 2001 and found to have several fractures to his arms. His mother originates from India but has lived in this country for many years. The local authority began proceedings on\n",

            "Target: Sona Devi, mother of respondents nos. 3, 4 and 5, inherited certain Zamindari property from her father. By a registered deed of sale she sold it to the predecessor in interest of the appellants and one Abhey Ram. At that time she had no son, but subsequently, respondents nos. 3 to 5 were born to her and at the time of her death all of them were minors. Respondents Nos. 3 to 5 filed a suit against the appellants and others for a declaration that their mother had only a life interest in the zamindari property sold by her, and that the transfer not having been supported by any legal necessity, was not binding upon them. They also prayed for recovery of possession of the property and for mesne profits. The suit was decreed by the Munsif. During the pendency of the appeals filed by both the parties, the village in which the disputed land is situate, was notified for consolidation operations and, therefore, in view of section 5 of the Consolidation Act, all further proceedings of the appeals were stayed. In the consolidation proceedings, the names of the appellants were recorded in the revenue papers as Bhumidar in respect of the disputed land. The respondents filed objections under section 12 of the Consolidation Act, raising questions of title regarding the disputed land. The Consolidation officer referred the matter under sub section I of section 12 to the statutory Arbitrator, who made an Award in favour of the Respondents and 488 recorded the findings that Sona Devi had only a life interest in the disputed land, that the sale deed executed by her was neither for legal necessity nor for the benefit of the estate of her deceased father, that the transfer of the disputed land by the sale deed was not binding on the respondents Nos. 3 to 5 and that they were entitled to reocover possession of the disputed land. Two petitions of objections to the Award, filed by the appellants, were dismissed by the Civil Judge. The Additional District Judge in second appeal took the view that as the sons of Abhey Ram, who was also one of the transferees under the said sale deed. were not made parties in the proceedings, the reference to the Arbitrator was illegal and the Award made by him was invalid, and that the Arbitrator was guilty of legal misconduct inasmuch as he had committed an error of law apparent on the face of the Award, allowed the appeals, and set aside the order of Civil Judge and also the Award of the Arbitrator. A Single Judge of the High Court allowed the Revision Petitions of the respondents, set aside the order of the Additional District Judge and restored that of the Civil Judge and also the Award of the Arbitrator. Dismissing the appeals, this Court, ^ HELD: 1. The object of sub section (2) of section 52 of the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act 1953 is that when an order has been passed by a Court under the provisions of the Constitution or in cases or proceedings pending under the Consolidation Act, the right or interest involved under such order or in the pending cases or proceedings under the Consolidation Act, should not be again subjected to the consideration in the consolidation proceedings started by virtue of a notification under section 4 A of the Consolidation Act. [495E F] 2. Section 4 A will apply only where the consolidation operations remained closed for a period of 10 years from the date of the notification under section 52(1). But, in view of section 52(2), consolidation operations shall be deemed to have not been closed in respect of two cases mentioned therein. So, section 4A will have no application to these two cases. Consequently, the provision of section 4 as also the provision of section 5 will not apply to these two cases. [495D E] 3. The proceedings out of which the instant appeals arise are l l proceedings under the Consolidation Act and, therefore, section 5(2)(a) will 489 have no application to these proceedings. In any event, in view of section 52(2), the notification issued under s.4 A and the subsequent notification under section 4(2) and the consequence thereof as provided under section 5(2) of the Consolidation Act, will have no application to or affect the proceedings giving rise to the instant appeals. [496A B] 4. The High Court was right in holding that the Additional District Judge should not have entertained the objection to the maintainability of the reference to the Arbitrator raised for the first time before him and that the proper stage for raising such an objection was when the reference was made under section 12 of the Consolidation Act. [496E F] 5. Since the sale deed in question has been held by the Arbitrator as invalid inasmuch as it was not supported by any legal necessity, the appellants had not acquired any interest in the disputed land under the sale deed and, as such, they had no intermediary interest in the disputed land on the date immediately preceding the date of vesting under the Zamindari Abolition Act. The appellants not being intermediaries or persons of any category as mentioned in section 18, they are not entitled to 1) retain the disputed land and their possession is not protected by the provision of section 18. [497C D] 6. Section 3 of the Uttar Pradesh (Supplementary) Act, 1952 does not confer any right on a person whose possession of land during the year 1359 Fasli was illegal. It is not the intention of the Legislature to protect the possession of a trespasser under section 3(1). The explanation to section 3(1) gives sufficient indication that a person not having any lawful right in the land. cannot claim to be in cultivatory possession of such land. [499A B] Ram Krishna vs Bhagwan Baksh Singh, and Badri and another vs Juthan Singh and others, ( , relied upon. In the instant case, in view of the findings of the Arbitrator, the appellants did not acquire any interest in the disputed land by virtue of the sale deed in question, and it cannot be said that they have acquired title to the disputed land by adverse possession. After the death of Sona Devi, the possession of the disputed land by the appellants became illegal and adverse to the respondents Nos. 3 to 5. But before such possession could ripen into title after the lapse of twelve years, the respondents Nos. 3 to S instituted a suit within six years of such possession in the Court of Munsif for the recovery of possession of the disputed land from the appellants, which was decreed. Both the appellants 490 and the respondent Nos. 3 to 5 filed appeals, but in view of section 5 of the Consolidation Act, all further proceedings of the said appeals were stayed. Thereafter, the consolidation proceedings were started giving rise to the present appeals. Thus, the appellants have not acquired any title to the disputed land by adverse possession. [498E H] \n",
            "Prediction: In the consolidation proceedings that were started in the village, the names of the appellants were recorded in the revenue papers as bhumi in respect of the disputed land. The respondents filed objections under section 12 of the Consolidation Act, as it stood at the relevant time in November, 1956. The Consolidation officer referred the matter under sub section (4) of section 12 to the statutory Arbitrator. The learned Arbitrator came to the findings that Sona Devi had only a life interest in the zamindari property purported to have been transferred by her by the sale deed dated December 21, 1935, and that the transfer not having been supported by any legal necessity, was not binding upon the respondents, the sons of the deceased father.

            "Target: The first appellant and the first respondent were married at Tirupati on 27.2.1975 according to Hindu Law. They separated in July 1978. The appellant husband filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage in the Sub Court of Tirupati stating that he was a resident of South Claiborn Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana, and that he was a citizen of India and that he and his wife last resided together at New Orleans, Louisiana. Subsequently he filed another petition for dissolution of marriage in the Circuit Court St. Louis Country, Missouri, USA alleging that he has been a resident of the State of Missouri for 90 days or more immediately preceding th filing of the petition by refusing to continue to live with the appellant in the US and particularly in the State of Missouri. But from the averments made by him in the petition before the Sub Judge, Tirupati it was obvious that he and his wife had last resided together at New Orleans, Louisiana and never within the jurisdiction of th Circuit Court of St. Louis Country in the State of Missouri. The respondent wife filed her reply raising her objections to the maintainability of the petition. She also clearly stated that her reply was without prejudice to her contention that she was not submitting to the jurisdiction of the foreign court. The Circuit Court Missouri assumed jurisdiction on the ground that the 1st Appellant had been a resident of the State of Missouri for 90 days next preceding the commencement of the action in the Court. In the absence of the respondent wife the Circuit Court, Missouri passed a decree for dissolution of marriage on the only ground that the marriage has irretrievably down. Subsequent to the passing of the decree by the Circuit Court, Missouri, the appellant filed an application for dismissal of his earlier petition before the Sub Court of Tirupati and the same was dismissed. 823 On 2nd November 1981 the last appellant married appellant No. 2. Thereafter, the 1st respondent filed a criminal complaint against the appellants for the offence of bigamy. The appellants filed an application for their discharge in view of the decree for dissolution of marriage passed by the Circuit Court, Missouri. The Magistrate discharged the appellants by holding that the complainant wife had failed to make out a prima facie case against the appellants. The respondent preferred a Criminal Revision Petition before the High Court which set aside the order of the Magistrate by holding (i) that a photostat copy of the judgment of Missouri Court was not admissible in evidence; (ii) since the Learned Magistrate acted on the photostat copy of the judgment, he was in error in discharging the accused. Accordingly the High Court directed the Magistrate to dispose of the petition filed by the appellants for their discharge afresh in accordance with law. Aggrieved by the decision of the High Court the appellants filed appeal in this Court. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1. The decree dissolving the marriage passed by the foreign court is without jurisdiction according to the as neither the marriage was celebrated nor the parties last resided together nor the respondent resided within the jurisdiction of that Court. Further, irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not one of the grounds recognised by the Act of dissolution of marriage. Hence, the decree of the divorce passed by the foreign court was on a ground unavailable under the Act which is applicable to the marriage. Since with regard to the jurisdiction of the forum as well as the ground on which it is passed the foreign decree in the present case is not in accordance with the Act under which the parties were married, and the respondent had not submitted to the jurisdiction of the court or consented to its passing, it cannot be recognised by the courts in this country and is therefore, unenforceable. [828H, 829A, 828E, 834H, 835A] 2. Residence does not mean a temporary residence for the purpose of obtaining a divorce but habitual residence or residence which is intended to be permanent for future as well. [829E] Smt. Satya vs Teja Singh, , referred to. The rules of Private International Law in this country are not codified and are scattered in different enactments such as the Civil Procedure Code, the Contract ACt, the Indian Succession Act, the Indian Divorce Act, the Special Marriage Act etc. In addition, some 824 rules have also been evolved by judicial decisions. In matters of status or legal capacity of natural persons, matrimonial disputes, custody of children, adoption, testamentary and intestate succession etc. the problem in this country is complicated by the fact that there exist different personal laws and no uniform rule can be laid down for all citizens. Today more than ever in the past, the need for definitive rules for recognition of foreign judgments in personal and family matters, and particularly in matrimonial disputes has surged to the surface. A large number of foreign decrees in matrimonial matters is becoming the order of the day. A time has, therefore, come to ensure certainty in the recognition of the foreign judgments in these matters. The minimum rules of guidance for securing the certainty need not await legislative initiative. This Court can accomplish the modest job within the frame work of the present statutory provisions if they are rationally interpreted and extended to achieve the purpose. Though the proposed rules of guidance in this area may prove inadequate or miss some aspects which may not be present to us at this juncture, yet a begining has to be made as best as one can, the lacunae and the errors being left to be filled in and corrected by future judgments. [829H, 830A, 831C, F H] 4. The relevant provisions of Section 13 of the CPC are capable of being interpreted to secure the required certainty in the sphere of this branch of law in conformity with public policy, justice, equity and good conscience, and the rules so evolved will protect the sanctity of the institution of marriage and the unity of family which are the corner stones of our social life. [832A] 4.1 On an analysis and interpretation of Section 13 of CPC the following rule can be deduced for recognising a foreign matrimonial judgment in this country. The jurisdiction assumed by the foreign court as well as the grounds on which the relief is granted must be in accordance with the matrimonial law under which the parties are married. The exceptions to this rule may be as follows; (i) where the matrimonial action is filed in the forum where the respondent is domiciled or habitually and permanently resides and the relief is granted on a ground available in the matrimonial law under which the parties are married; (ii) where the respondent voluntarily and effectively submits to the jurisdiction of the forum and contests the claim which is based on a ground available under the matrimonial law under which the parties are married; (iii) where the respondent consents to the grant of the relief although the jurisdiction of the forum is not in accordance with the provisions of the matrimonial law of the parties. [834B D] 825 5. The High Court erred in setting aside the order of the learned Magistrate only on the ground that the photostat copy of the decree was not admissible in evidence. In the instant case photostat copies of the judicial record of the Court of St. Louis is certified for th Circuit Clerk by the Deputy clerk who is a public officer having the custody of the document within the meaning of Section 76 of the also in the manner required by the provisions of the said section. Hence the photostat copy per se is not inadmissible in evidence. It is inadmissible because it has not further been certified by the representative of our Central Government in the United States as required by Section 86 of the Act. Therefore the document is not admissible in evidence for want of the certificate under Section 86 of the Act and not because it is a photostat copy of the original as held by the High Court. [835B, E, F G] 6. The Magistrate is directed to proceed with th matter pending before him according to law as expeditiously as possible, preferably within four months. [835G] \n",

On August 14, 1991 the learned Magistrate discharged the appellant holding that the complainant had failed to make out a prima facie case against the appellants and that the marriage was, therefore, irretrievably broken. On April 18, 1987 the High Court set aside the order of the magistrate holding that a photostat copy of the judgment of the Missouri court was not admissible in evidence to prove the dissolution of the marriage.

She was called for written test and also for interview and was successful in both the tests. She had to file a declaration form which she submitted to the corporation on May 25, 1989. On the same day she was also examined by a lady doctor who was on the panel of the corporation and found medically fit for the job. Thereafter she underwent a short term training programme and given a letter of appointment dated September 25, 1989. She was put on probation for a period of six months and was entitled to be confirmed in the service, subject to satis factory work report. The petitioner took leave from December 9, 1989 till March 8, 1990. She applied for maternity leave on December 27, 1989 followed by medical certificate dated January 6, 1990. She delivered a full term baby on January 11, 1990 in Dr. Hira Lal 's Nursing Home and was discharged from there on January 19, 1990. On February 13, 1990 the petitioner was discharged from the service during her period of probation. No ground was assigned and the order seemed to be a discharge simplicitor. The petitioner moved the High Court, and the High Court, refused to interfere with the termination since the peti tioner 's work during the period of probation. was found to be not satisfactory. Thereafter the petitioner appealed to this Court. After preliminary hearing the court issued an interim mandamus directing 147 the respondent to put the petitioner back to service within 15 days from the date of receipt of the court order and also issued notice for final hearing. The corporation upon service of notice, filed the coun ter seeking to justify the termination of petitioner 's services on two grounds: (1) that the petitioner had delib erately withheld to mention the fact of being in the family way at the time of filling up the declaration form before medical examination for fitness. The same was revealed only when she informed the corporation that she had given birth to a daughter. (2) Her work during the probation was not satisfactory. So it was an order of discharge simplicitor. The Corporation further made reference to Instruction No.16 as to the medical examination for recruitment of class 1II and IV staff, wherein for the purpose of appointment, if at the time of medical examination any lady applicant is preg nant, her appointment shall be considered three months after the delivery. Granting the appeal, the Court, HELD: While we arc moving forward to achieve the consti tutional guarantee of equal rights for women, the Life Insurance Corporation of India seems to be not moving beyond the status quo. In the instant case there is nothing on record to indicate that the petitioner 's work during the probation was not satisfactory. The reason for termination was only the declaration given by her at the stage of enter ing the service, though the petitioner was medically exam ined by the lady doctor and found her medically fit to join the post. [148 D, E, 151 C] The real mischief though unintended is the nature of the declaration required from a lady candidate specially the particulars required to be furnished under columns (iii) to (viii) which are indeed embarrassing if not humilating. The modesty and self respect may perhaps preclude the disclosure of such personal problems. The corporation would do well to delete such columns in the declaration. If the purpose of the declaration is to deny the maternity leave and benefits to a lady candidate who is pregnant at the time of entering the service, the Corporation could subject her to medical examination including the pregnancy test.

By virtue of a provision in the partnership deed, the business of the firm was continued by the surviving partners. The respondents, being the widow and son of D commenced an action for an account of the partnership between D and the surviving partners, praying for an order for the payment of the amount determined to be due to D at the time of his death. A single judge of the High Court passed a preliminary decree directing that an account be taken of the partnership as on February 20, 1957. A Division Bench, in appeal, modified the decree holding that the respondents were entitled only to interest at 6 % p.a. on. the amount of D 's share in the assets of the partnership, including good will. In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the respondents as legal representatives of D were not entitled to a share in the value of the good will of the firm because good will may be taken into account only when there is a dissolution and not otherwise; and. furthermore, because D had agreed that his interest in the good will would cease after his death and the business shall be continued by the _surviving, partners. HELD : Dismissing the appeal, It could not be held that in interpreting a deed of partnership, business. whereof, it is stipulated shall be continued by the surviving I partners after the death of a partner, the Court will not award to the legal representatives of the deceased partner a share in the goodwill in the absence of an express stipulation to the contrary. The good will of a firm is an. asset of the firm. In interpreting the deed of partnership, the Court will insist upon, some indication that the right to a share in the assets is, by virtue of the agreement that the surviving partners are entitled to carry on the business on the death of the partner, to be extinguished. In the absence of a provision expressly made or clearly implied, the normal rule that the share of a partner in the assets devolves upon his legal representatives will apply to the good will as well as to other assets. [693 F H] There is no indication in section 55 of the Partnership Act that goodwill may be taken into account only when there is a general dissolution of the firm,. and not when the reprensentatives of a partner claim his share in the firm, which by express stipulations is to continue not with standing the death of a partner. Nor do sections 39, 42 and 46 of the Act support such a contention.[691 F] Hunter vs Dowling, [18951 ; Smith vs Nelson 96 Law Times Reports 313; Bachubai and L. A.

            "Target: Disputes having arisen between the appellant and the respondent, they were referred to arbitration in accordance with an arbitration agreement. The arbitrators entered upon the reference and also appointed an umpire. After the time for making the award had expired the appellant took the stand that one of the arbitrators would be biased in favour of the respondents. The respondents therefore called upon the arbitrators to refer the matter to the umpire and also wrote to the umpire and the umpire entered upon the reference. Thereafter, the appellants filed applications under section 33 of the . The High Court held that the umpire rightly entered upon the reference, and extended the time to enable the umpire to make an award. In appeal to this Court it was contended that : (1) the appointment of the umpire was not valid because the consent of the appointee was not obtained,; and (2) under cl. 6 of the Arbitration agreement the operation of para 4 Sch. I of the was excluded, and the umpire could enter upon the reference only in the event of a difference arising between the arbitrators and the arbitrators referred the matter to the umpire. Dismissing the appeal, HELD : (1) There is a distinction between appointment and acceptance of an office. The question of effectiveness or perfection is ordinarily subsequent to appointment. The scheme of arbitration proceedings indicates that the appointment of an umpire and the acceptance of office are two separate matters arising at different stages in the proceedings. [699 H; 700 A: 704 E] When the arbitrators are required to appoint an umpire it only means that the arbitrators are to concur in appointing the umpire. There is no particular method of appointment of an umpire though the usual method is by writing. Arbitrators who are required to appoint an umpire are under no obligation to obtain the approval of the choice of the person by the parties who appointed the arbitrators. If any party is dissatisfied with the choice it will not affect the validity of the appointment; nor is the appointment conditional upon the acceptance of appointment by the umpire. The necessity for communication of appointment to the parties as well as to the appointee depends on the language of the arbitration clause. The does not say that the appointment of umpire by the arbitrators is to be made only after obtaining the consent of the appointee. [700 D E; 701 D F; 704 D E] When the umpire assumes his office he accepts the appointment. Acceptance may be express or implied. It need not be in writing; it may be evidenced by conduct. It may also be evidenced by proceeding with 696 the arbitration. When the umpire is called upon to proceed in terms of the appointment he will either assent expressly or by conduct to act, or he will decline to act.

On the contrary the agreement shows that the intention of the parties was that when the arbitrators allowed time to expire without making the award the umpire should enter on the reference in lieu of the arbitrators.

Where one of the arbitrators declines to act and the other is left alone in a case of this type, it will amount to disagreement between the arbitrators.

            "Target: The appellant, Parshotam Lal Dhingra, was appointed to the Indian Railway Service as a Signaller (Telegraphist) in 1924 and was promoted to the post of Chief Controller in 1950, both the posts being in class III Service. On July 2, 1951, he was appointed to officiate in class II Service as Asst. Superintendent Railway Telegraphs. On certain adverse remarks made against him in his Confidential Report for the year ending March 31, 1953, the General Manager on June 21. 1953, remarked as follows \"I am disappointed to read these reports. He should revert as a subordinate till he makes good the short coming noticed in this chance of his as an officer. Portions underlined to be communicated to him. \" Thereupon the appellant made a representation, but on (I) ; 829 August 19, 1953, the General Manager issued a notice as follows: \"Shri Bishambar Nath Chopra, Instructor Railway Training School, Saharnpur, is transferred to Headquarters office and appointed to officiate in Class II service as Assistant Signal and Tele Communication Engineer (Telegraphs) vice Shri Parshotam Lal Dhingra who on relief reverts to Class III T appointment. \" Against this order the appellant moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution. The single judge who heard the matter held that the order was invalid as the provisions of article 311(2) of the Constitution had not admittedly been complied with. The Division Bench on appeal, however, set aside the order of the Single judge and dismissed the appellant 's writ application. The question for decision was whether the order of the General Manager amounted to a reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311(2) of the Constitution and the appellant was entitled to a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the order. Held (per Das, C. J., Venkatarama Aiyar, section K. Das, A. K. Sarkar jj., Vivian Bose J., dissenting) that the order of reversion made against the petitioner did not amount to a reduction in rank within the meaning of article 311(2) Of the Constitution and he was not entitled to the protection of that Article. Like article 31O of the Constitution, which makes no distinction between persons holding permanent or temporary posts in the matter of their tenure being dependent on the pleasure of the President or the Governor, article 311 which is in the nature of a proviso to article 310, also makes no distinction between permanent and temporary posts and extends its protection equally to all Government servants holding permanent or temporary posts or officiating in any of them.

But the protection of article 31I can be available only where dismissal, removal or reduction in rank is sought to be inflicted by way of punishment and not otherwise. These were the major punishments evolved by the Service Rules and Rules of the Railway Code, and well understood as such, against which protection was sought to be provided by the Rules. These protections were in due course incorporated in section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and reproduced in article 311 of the Constitution, thus qualifying the principle embodied in article 310(1).

One test for determining whether the termination of service was by way of punishment or otherwise is to ascertain whether under the Service Rules, but for such termination, the servant has the right to hold the post. In the three cases of (1) substantive appointment to a permanent post, (2) temporary appointment for a fixed term and (3) a temporary appointment which has ripened into a quasi permanent status under the Temporary Service Rules, where such a right exists, the servant will be entitled to the protection of article 311. Conversely, where no such right can exist, as in the case of a probationary or officiating appointment to a permanent or temporary post or where the service has not ripened into a quasi permanent status, and under the general law the service can be terminated on reasonable notice, the termination of service cannot amount to a punishment and attract the Article. Broadly speaking, article 311(2) can apply to those cases where the Government servant, if in private employment, could maintain an action for wrongful dismissal, removal or reduction in rank. So where the Government has, by contract, express or implied, or under the Rules, the right to terminate the service at any time, such termination, in the manner provided in the contract or under the Rules, cannot attract the provisions of article 311. That does not, however, mean that the termination of service of a servant who has no right to the post can never be a dismissal or removal by way of punishment. Although in such a termination the actual motive of the Government must be wholly irrelevant, where it expressly chooses to penalise the servant for misconduct, negligence, inefficiency or the like by inflicting on him the punishment of dismissal, removal or reduction, the requirements of article 311 must be complied with. Satish Chander Anand vs The Union of India, (1953) S.C.R. 655 Shyam Lal vs The State of Uttar Pradesh, (1955) 1 S.C.R. 26 and Shrinivas Ganesh vs Union of India, L.R. 58 Bom. 673, referred to. A reduction in rank must, similarly, be a punishment if it carries penal consequences with it and the two tests to be applied are (1) whether the servant has a right to the post or the rank or (2) whether evil consequences such as forfeiture of pay or allowances, loss of seniority in his substantive rank, stoppage or postponement of future chances of promotion, follow as a result of the order. Where either of these tests applies, the reduction in 831 rank mast be one within the meaning of article 311 (2) of the Constitution and attract its protection. In the instant case, the appellant was holding an officiating post and had no right under the rules of the Railway Code to continue in it. Under the general law such appointment was terminable at, any time on reasonable notice, and the reduction could not operate ' as a forfeiture of any right. The order of the General Manager visited him with no evil consequences. Consequently, he was not reduced in rank by way of punishment. Per Bose J. While there can be no doubt that article 311 applies to all classes of Government Servants whether permanent, quasipermanent, officiating, temporary or on probation and that the words dismissal, removal and reduction in rank used therein have a special meaning, that Article, properly construed, cannot be confined to the penalties prescribed by the Service Rules. The gist of it is neither the form of the action nor the procedure nor what operated in the mind of the competent authority. The real test is whether evil consequences over and above those that would ensue from a \"contractual termination\" are likely to ensue. If they are, article 311 is attracted even though such evil consequences are not prescribed as \"penalties\" under the Rules. Though the conditions of service prescribed by the Rules can be varied unilaterally in some cases because of the \"pleasure\" of the President, they cannot be ignored as long as they stand, and if they are infringed while in force, article 311 will be attracted in an appropriate case. Satish Chandya Anand vs Union of India, ; and Shyam Lal vs State of Uttar Pradesh, ; , referred to. Nor can the protections afforded by article 311 be nullified by a splitting up of the order. In the present case the General Manager 's remarks in the confidential file, which formed a part of the operative order and was its real foundation, clearly indicated the mischief, that the appellant was not to be promoted to a like post until in the opinion of some competent Officer he had made good his previous short comings. That was an evil consequence, over and above that which would follow from a mere \"contractual termination\" of his engagement in the higher post, and so was sufficient to attract the protection of article 311. \n",

            "Target: Under ss.4 and 5 of the Assam Municipal Act, 1923, the Provincial Government was authorised to signify its intention to include within a municipality any local area in its vicinity, and, after considering. any objections to the proposed action to so include the area. Section 328 provided for the constitution of notified areas. Sections 4 and 5 were not applicable to a notified area but the Provincial Government could extend to any notified area any section of the Act by virtue of section 330(1)(d). Under section 330(3), for the purpose of any section so extended, the town committee constituted for such notified area would be deemed to be a Municipal Board. In 1957, the 1923 Act was repealed and was replaced by the Assam Municipal Act, 1957. The respondent owned tea gardens in the village of Nazira. In 1909, a town committee was constituted at Nazira adjacent to the tea garden. In 1951, by a notification issued by the Government of Assam, s.4(1)(b) and (c), and s.5(1) and (2)(b) of the 1923 Act were extended to the notified area committee including the Nazira Town Committee. On January 6, 1964, a notification was issued under the 1957Act to revise the boundaries of the notified area at Nazira, and after considering the objections of the respondent on September 30, 1964, by a final notification, a part of its tea estate was incorporated within the Nazira Town Committee. On the question whether notifications dated January 6, 1964 and September 30, 1964 were unauthorised, because, sections 4 and 5 of 1957 Act, corresponding to sections 4 and 5 of the 1923 Act, were not extended to the notified area on these dates, HELD : There is no express provision in the 1957 Act which supersedes the notification issued in 1951 under the 1923 Act nor is the continuance of the notification inconsistent with any provision in the 1957 Act. Therefore, under section 26 of the Assam General Clauses Art, 1915, the 1951 notification continues in force and must be deemed to have been issued under the 1957 Act. Hence, the State Government was competent, in exercise of the power conferred upon it by the 1957 Act, to include within the area of the Town Committee any local area contiguous to it.

            "Target: The respondents were two groups of shareholders of a private limited company which had a thousand persons under its employment. A group of shareholders filed a petition for winding up the company under cls. (e) and (f) of section 433 of the Indian along with applications for an interim injunction and for appointment of a provisional liquidator. The Company Judge passed an order of injunction restraining the company from borrowing any moneys from banks, financial institutions or others without the prior permission of the court. Three trade unions representing the employees of the company filed applications for being impleaded as respondents/interveners in the winding up petition claiming that the interests of the employees had been adversely affected by the interim order. The Company Judge rejected these applications. A Division Bench of the High Court turned down the appeal preferred by one of the unions and that union sought special leave to appeal against the order of the Division Bench while the other two unions sought special leave to appeal against the order of the Company Judge. The Court granted special leave to all the three unions and permitted the Company Judge to pass orders on the application pending before him for appointment of a provisional liquidator with the direction that the liquidator shall not take any steps which would prejudicially affect the employees. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that since an order winding up a company amounts to notice of termination of services of its employees under section 445(3) and since even an interim order freezing the resources of the company might affect the interest of the employees by making it difficult for the company to pay their wages, etc., it would be contrary to fair judicial procedure and violative of the rule audi alteram partem to deny the employees the right to be heard before any order prejudicially affecting their interests is made. The 923 employees who contribute materially to the working of a company and enable it to effectively play its socio economic role are equal, if not more important, partners in the running of the company and they must be heard in a proceeding for winding up of the company. It was further urged that under r.34 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 the employees have a right to appear at the hearing of a winding up petition either to support or to oppose it. On behalf of the respondents it was contended that the employees of a company have no locus standi in a winding up petition as the Act does not contain any provision conferring such a right on them; that since the Act is a self contained Code exhaustive in regard to all matters relating to a company, no such right could be spelt out in their favour outside the provisions of the Act that r. 34 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 does not confer such a right on them and that, under the various provisions of the Act including sections 439 and 440, it is only the creditors and contributories and in certain specified contingencies, the Registrar and the Central Government, who are entitled to participate in the proceedings for winding up of a company. It was further contended that in this case it was not even the employees, but the three trade unions, who had applied for being heard, and since the trade unions had no right to be heard, their applications had been rightly rejected. Allowing the appeals, ^ HELD : By Majority : Per Bhagwati, Chinnappa Reddy and Baharul Islam, JJ. (Venkataramiah and Amarendra Nath Sen, JJ. dissenting): The workers of a company are entitled to appear at the hearing of the winding up petition whether to support or to oppose it. They have a locus standi to appear and be heard both before the petition is admitted and an order for advertisement is made as also after the admission and advertisement of the petition until an order is made for winding up the company. The workers also have a right of appeal against a winding up order. But when a winding up order has become final, the workers ordinarily would not have any right to participate in any proceeding in the course of winding up, the company though there may be rare cases where in a proceeding in the course of winding up, the interests of the workers may be involved and in such a case it may be possible to contend that the workers must be heard before an order is made by the court. Even in an application for appointment of a provisional liquidator the workers have a right to be heard if they so wish but neither the petitioner in the winding up petition nor the court is under any obligation to give notice of such application to the workers. [956 A E] In the instant case the circumstance that the workers were not heard by the Company Judge before he passed the order appointing the provisional liquidator would not have the effect of vitiating the order but it would be open to the workers to apply to the court for vacating that order. [956 F G] (i) The making of a winding up order on a petition for winding up would have an adverse consequence on the workers inasmuch as the continuance of their service would be seriously jeopardised and their right to work and earn 924 their livelihood would be disastrously imperilled. It is an elementary principle of law that no order involving adverse civil consequences can be passed against any person without giving him an opportunity to be heard against the passing of such order. If the audi alteram partem rule has been held to be applicable in a quasi judicial or even in an administrative proceeding, it would a fortiori apply in a judicial proceeding such as a petition for winding up of a company. No system of law which is designed to promote justice through fair play in action can permit the court to make a winding up order which has the effect of bringing about termination of the services of the workers without giving them an opportunity of being heard against the making of such order. Unless there is express provision in the Act which forbids the workers from appearing at the hearing, the workers must be held entitled to appear and be heard in the winding up petition. [950 A E] State of Orissa vs Dr. Bina Pani, ; ; A.K. Kraipak vs Union of India, and Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 621 referred to. (ii) There is no provision in the Act which excludes the workers from appearing at the hearing of a winding up petition. Merely because the right to apply for winding up a company is not given to them it does not follow as a necessary consequence that the workers have no right to appear and be heard in a winding up petition filed by one or more of the persons specified in section 439. In fact, there would be no point in conferring that right on the workers since they cannot have any interest in demolishing the enterprise which is the source of their livelihood. So also, the circumstance that the right to make applications or be consulted in the course of the winding up of a company is conferred under section 440 and other provisions of the Act only on the creditors and contributories does not in any way militate against the right of the workers to appear and be heard in the winding up petition. Once the winding up order is made, the assets of the company have to be realised, the creditors to be paid and if there is any surplus it has to be distributed among the contributories and, therefore, at that stage, it is only the creditors and contributories who have an interest and that is why in the course of the winding up it is the creditors and contributories who have been given a voice. Sections 440, 464, 466, 478, 517, 542, 543, 549, 556, 557 and 560 deal with a stage after the winding up has commenced. These sections have nothing to do with the question whether the company should be wound up or not. D F; 951 B; 951 C E; 949 A H] (iii) After the amendment of sections 397 and 398 of the Act by sections 10 and 11 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963, the court, while deciding whether a company should be bound up, has to take into consideration not only the interest of the shareholders and editors but also public interest in the shape of the need of the community and the interest of employees. It is therefore axiomatic that the workers must have an opportunity of being heard for projecting and safeguarding their interest before a winding up order in made. [951 G: 952 E F] In the instant case, the Division Bench of the High Court, after conceding that the court had to take into consideration the interest of the workers, went wrong in holding that the workers had no locus standi to file an application for being heard in the winding up petition.

Ltd. and Ors. , , approved. (iv) It is true that according to the statement of law contained in the leading text books on Company Law, it is only the Company, the creditors and the contributories who are entitled to appear in a winding up petition and no other persons have a right to be heard. This statement of the law is based on a decision rendered by the English Courts over a hundred years ago when a company was regarded merely as a legal device brought into being as a result of a contractual arrangement between the shareholders for the purpose of carrying on trade or business and the workers were looked upon as no more than employees of the company working under a master and servant relationship and the interest of the public as consumers or otherwise was a totally irrelevant consideration. It can have no validity in the present times when the entire concept of a company has changed. [953 F H] In re. Bradford Navigation Company [1870] 5 Ch. A.C. 600, held inapplicable. In re. Edward Textiles Limited, , overruled. (v) Our Constitution has shown profound concern for the workers and given them a pride of place in the new socio economic order envisaged in the Preamble and the Directive Principles of State Policy. Article 43A states that the State shall take steps by suitable legislation or in any other way to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged in any industry. The constitutional mandate is therefore clear and undoubted that the management of the enterprise should not be left entirely in the hands of the suppliers of capital but the workers should also be entitled to participate in it. In a socialist pattern of society the enterprise which is a centre of economic power should be controlled not only by capital but also by labour. It cannot therefore be contended that the workers should have no voice in the determination of the question whether the enterprise should continue to run or be shut down under an order of the court. The workers who have contributed to the building of the enterprise have every right to be heard when it is sought to demolish that centre of economic power. [946 C; 947 D F] People 's Union for Democratic Rights vs Union of India and Ors. (W.P. No. 8143 of 1981 decided on September 18, 1982) referred to. (vi) It is not only the shareholders who have supplied capital who are interested in the enterprise which is being run by a company but the workers who supply labour are also equally, interested because what is produced by the enterprise is the result of labour as well as capital. The owners of capital bear only limited financial risk and otherwise contribute nothing to production while labour contributes a major share of the product. While the former invest only a part of their moneys the latter invest their sweat and toil; in fact, their life itself. 926 The workers therefore have a special place in a socialistic pattern of society. They are no more vendors of toil; they are not a marketable commodity to be purchased by the owners of capital. They are producers of wealth as much as capital; they supply labour without which capital would be impotent. [945 G H: 946 A B] (vii) The concept of a company has undergone radical transformation in the last few decades. The old nineteenth century view which regarded a company merely as a legal device adopted by shareholders for carrying on trade or business as proprietors has been discarded and a company is now looked upon as a socioeconomic institution wielding economic power and influencing the life of the people. The view that a company is the property of the shareholders can no longer be regarded as valid. Apart from capital and labour there are other factors which contribute to the production of national wealth; the financial institutions and depositors who provide the additional finance required for production and the consumers and the rest of the members of the community who are vitally interested in the product manufactured. A company, according to the new socio economic thinking, is a social institution having duties and responsibilities towards the community in which it functions and one of its paramount objectives is to bring about maximisation of social welfare and common good. This necessarily involves reorientation of thinking in regard to the duties and obligations of the company not only vis a vis the shareholders but also vis a vis the rest of the community affected by its operations such as workers, consumers and the Government representing the society.

(concurring) (i) Quite apart from section 445(3), it is plain that the future of the workers is at stake and their right to work is in jeopardy as a result of the presentation of the winding up petition. The workers are so intimately tied up that their interest in the survival and the well being of the company is much more than the interest of any shareholder. They cannot be denied a hearing when their very existence is under threat of extinction. [957 D G] (ii) It is not correct to say that natural justice is exclusively a principle of administrative law. It is first a universal principle and, therefore, a rule of administrative law. Courts, even more than administrators, must observe natural justice. [959 A C] (iii) The Act does not prohibit a hearing to the workers. It does not provide for all situations. The law \"falls to be applied to a growing and changing subject matter\". The Company Judge must acknowledge the transformation which corporations are presently undergoing from capitalist contrivances into socialist instruments and recognize the reality of the workers interest. The 927 working classes, all the world over, are demanding \"workers ' control\" and \"industrial democracy\". They want the right to work to be secured. Our Constitution has accepted the workers ' entitlement to control and it is one of the Directive Principles of State Policy. It is in this context of changing norms and waxing values that the workers ' demand to be heard has to be judged. [957 G H; 958 B C E F G] (iv) The duty to hear those asking to be heard is not dependent on the vesting of any right under the very statute in respect of which jurisdiction is being exercised by the Court but on any right whatever which may come under threat. It is not the law that rights other than those created by a particular statute may be taken away in proceedings under that statute without affording a hearing to those desiring to be heard. [959 D E] (v) It is not correct to say that once the workers are allowed to enter the company court, the flood gates will be opened, all and sundry will join in the fray and utter confusion will prevail. The court is the master of the proceedings and the ultimate control is with the court. Parties may not be impleaded for the mere asking. The court may ask the reason why, if someone asks to be heard. [960 B C] (vi) The contention that since workers are not allowed to intervene in a partition or dissolution of partnership they should also not be allowed to intervene in a winding up petition cannot be accepted. There is no reason why workers may not be allowed, in appropriate cases to intervene in such actions to avert disaster and to promote welfare. [960 D] (vii) There is good reason for holding that In re. Bradford Navigation Company is not valid in the present times. It was decided in the heydays of laissez faire at a time when individualism dominated every field and the public interest was but a slow runner. Now the position is reversed. In Britain itself Corporate law and labour law have changed considerably. After nationalisation of certain important and crucial industries a considerable measure of workers ' control of management of industry has been achieved in that country. One should rather look to the Constitution for guidance and inspiration while interpreting the laws. After the 42nd Amendment, the Constitution is openly Socialist. The Directive Principles of State Policy emphasize the role and interest of the workers. article 43A contemplates workers ' participation in the management of the industry. There are several provisions in the Act itself which take notice of the element of public interest. There are other enactments like the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act and the Industries Regulation and Development Act under whose provisions the activities of a company may be scrutinized in public interest. There are legislations involving employment and welfare of labour to which the managements of the companies are subject. The problem before the court must be considered in this context of ferment and development. G H; 962 A B; 960 G H; 961 D F] In re. Bradford Navigation Company, [1870] 5 Ch.

(concurring) The statement of law contained in the English authorities cited by counsel for respondents may be good law for England with altogether a different system of economy but it is not applicable in our country, particularly after the Constitution (42nd Amendment) Act, 1976, by which the \"Socialist\" and \"Secular\" concepts have been incorporated in the Preamble to our Constitution. The workers ' right to be heard in a winding up proceeding has to be spelt out from the Preamble and articles 38 and 43 A of the Constitution and from the general principles of natural justice. [990 D F] per Venkataramiah and Amarendra Nath Sen, JJ. (dissenting) Under the existing law the workers or their unions may make any suggestions to the Court at any stage but they cannot claim to be impleaded as parties to the winding up petition as of right. The privilege of making suggestions to the court in public interest is different from the right to be impleaded as a party with the concomitant right to enter into contest with the other parties and of making an order in appeal before higher courts. The latter right has to be conferred expressly by the statute in any person who wishes to exercise it. [979 D] (i) The principles of administrative law have not much relevance to the administration of the affairs of a company, the primary purpose of administrative law being the imposition of checks on the powers of government or its officers so that they may not either abuse their powers or go out of their legal bounds. In particular, the proceedings relating to winding up by court are subject to the orders of higher courts in appeal and are not amenable to interference by superior courts as in the case of actions of government or its officers. [967 H, 968 A B] (ii) The law on the question as to who can be heard as of right in a winding up proceeding is clear and is based on the decision of the English Court in In re. Bradford Navigation Company. The decision may be of the last century but there is hardly any justification to depart from it even now unless compelled by the statute to do so.[970 B D; 971 E] In re. Bradford Navigation Company, [1870] 5 Ch. A.C. 600, referred to. Halsbury 's Laws of England (4th Ed.) Vol. 7 Para 1028 referred to. (iii) That only the company, creditors and contributories (apart from the Central Government or the Registrar when they choose to intervene under the express provisions of the Act) are entitled to participate in the winding up proceedings is clear from sections 439, 447 and 557. Sections 450(2), 466, 478(3), 517, 518, 542, 543, 546(1), 549(1) and 556 show that only the Company, the official liquidator, liquidator, creditors, contributories or the Registrar have a statutory right to participate as of right in the winding up proceedings. The workers or their trade unions have not been given any such right. [969 C D; E H; 973 A F] 929 In re. Edward Textiles Ltd., approved. (iv) Under section 433, a company may be wound up by the court on one or more of the following grounds : (a) if the company has, by special resolution, resolved that it may be wound up by court; (b) if default is made in delivering the statutory report to the Registrar or in holding the statutory meeting; (c) if the company does not commence its business within a year from its incorporation, or suspends its business for a whole year; (d) if the number of members is reduced, in the case of a public company, below seven, and in the case of a private company, below two; (e) if the company is unable to pay its debts; and (f) if the court is of opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up. As regards the ground mentioned at (a), when a company has passed a special resolution that it may be wound up by the court, the employees and workers can have hardly any ground to object. The position is the same when any of the defaults mentioned in (b) and (c) are committed by the company. The officers and employees of the company also cannot get over the deficiency in the required number of members of a company referred to in (d) above. When a company is unable to pay its debts and a creditor moves a petition for winding up under (e) above, he cannot be compelled to prove his claim not merely against the company but also against the officers and employees. When there is a deadlock in the management of the company arising out of disputes amongst the directors or when some directors without any justification exclude some other directors from the management of the company and a petition for winding up is filed under (f), above, it would be unreasonable to expect the excluded directors to fight a case both against the directors who are responsible for their exclusion and also against the officers and employees who are neither creditors nor contributories but who may be supporting the contesting directors. [968 H; 969 A B; 969 F H; 970 A B] In the instant case, it is seen from the grounds of objection filed by the trade unions that they are only interested in supporting the cause of one set of respondents against the other by making certain general submissions. The petitioners in the Company Petition would be in a more disadvantageous position if they have to face the opposition of the trade unions also in addition to the respondents to that petition. Such a situation should not be created by extending the area of controversy by a liberal interpretation of the provisions of law when there are no compelling reasons to do so. [985 E G] (v) There are specific provisions in the Act and the Rules (sections 417 to 420, 530(1)(b) to (f) and 635 B and r. 152 read with Form No. 67) dealing with the rights of employees of a company. The right to resist a winding up petition is not one such right. [975 D E] (vi) It is because of some doubts that had been expressed earlier about the continuance of the employment of the employees of a company ordered to be compulsorily wound up that section 445(3) was enacted making it clear that the passing of the order of winding up amounts to a notice of discharge of the employees concerned. Section 445(3) corresponds to the termination of service brought about by the abolition of a post under a Government or by the closure of a business, neither of which as the law stands today requires compliance with the principles of natural justice. [975 B C] 930 (vii) It is true that public interest which may include within its scope interests of employees of a company has to be kept in view by the courts in exercising certain powers under the Act. Sections 388 B, 394, 396, 397 and 408 do refer to the concept of public interest. These provisions deal with the powers of the Central Government and the Court. They do not, however, state that trade unions can as of right intervene in the proceedings arising under them. [975 F H] Bhalchandra Dharmajee Makaji and Ors. vs Alcock, Ashdown and Co. Ltd. and Ors., referred to. In the instant case the High Court has passed necessary orders to protect the interests of the employees. As these orders stand today, the workers can always approach the High Court by way of a company application for appropriate orders whenever they feel that their working conditions are adversely affected during the pendency of the proceedings. It is not necessary that the workers or the trade unions should be impleaded as parties to the winding up petition enabling them to contest the same; their presence on record is not necessary for a complete and effectual adjudication of the petition. The trade unions are, therefore, neither necessary nor proper parties to the winding up petition on the facts and in the circumstances of this case including the element of public interest involved in any liquidation proceeding. [985 H; 986 H; 987 A C] (viii) In Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union (Regd) Sindri and Ors. vs Union of India and Ors. , [1981] 2 S.C.R. 52 the court was concerned with operations in a public sector company and the activities of the government. The observations contained therein cannot have any relevance to a case involving the affairs of a company which is governed only by the express provisions of company law and other relevant statutes. [982 C] (ix) As the law stands today, the workers in a factory owned by a company do not have any hand in the birth of a company, in its workingur ding its existence and also in its death by dissolution. Workers ' participation in the affairs of a company or the ushering in of an industrial democracy is quite a laudable object. That is the reason for enacting article 43 A. article 43 A clearly states that the State shall take steps by suitable legislation or in any other way to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings etc. The High powered Expert Committee on Companies and MRTP Act, has made certain recommendations in this behalf in paragraphs 11.27 and 18.137 of its report and it is for the Parliament to take steps to implement them. The legislature has not taken concrete steps in this regard. The suggestions made by the committee emphasize that at present workers have no right to contest winding up proceedings. It is significant that there is no recommendation made even in this report about the right of trade unions to contest winding up petitions. The court cannot step in and introduce drastic amendments into the company law. Many of the Directive Principles are still to be implemented by passing appropriate legislation. This Court cannot compel the executive by issuing writs to implement the policy underlying them. There are well recognized limitations on the power of the court making inroads into the legitimate domain of the legislature. If the legislature exceeds its power, this Court steps in. If the executive exceeds its power, 931 then also this court steps in. If this court exceeds its power what can people do ? Should they be driven to seek an amendment of the law on every occasion ? The only proper solution is the observance of restraint by this court in its pronouncements so that they do not go beyond its own legitimate sphere. It may be that the workers who are likely to be affected by the winding up need a larger protection. That can be done only by legislative action. This Court cannot make any order which will conflict with the existing law. [982 G H; 983 A; 977 E F; 983 G; 983 B D; 989 C] (x) The proposition that law should not be static but should grow cannot be disputed. But it should be the result of the exercise of legislative judgment, particularly when a departure from express provisions of a statute or an established practice is to be made. A discussion involving a comprehensive view of all interests which are likely to be affected by any decision in such a matter is not possible before a court where only the parties to a case or their lawyers are heard. [987 D F] (xi) It is not correct to say that there is no other remedy at all for workmen who are likely to be affected by the winding up order made by the court. It is open to the workers or their trade unions to move the Central Government to take appropriate steps under the Industrial (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 the provisions of which provide that where a company owning an industrial undertaking is being wound up by or under the supervision of the High Court and the business of such company is not being continued, the Central Government may investigate into the possibility of running or restarting the industrial undertaking, provide relief to it or take steps to ensure that the undertaking is sold as a running concern, or prepare a scheme of reconstruction of the company and send it to the trade unions of employees concerned inviting their suggestions and objections. [976 A H; 977 A C] (xii) When once the right to contest a winding up petition is extended to workers either on the principle of equity or of administrative law, on the same principle it would logically follow that all others who may have dealings with the company such as commission agents, selling agents. whose contracts with the company are going to be terminated by reason of its liquidation also have to be allowed to contest the proceedings. Such a claim is not permissible. [974 B] Ex parte Maclure, , referred to. (xiii) It is no doubt true that the view of the High Court is also in conformity with the view prevailing in England. That does not mean that the High Court has surrendered its judgment to a foreign practice because that is the very view which is being followed till now in the Indian Courts. A foreign decision is either worthy of acceptance or not depending upon the reasons contained in it and not its origin or age. There is no reason why we should not follow a well reasoned foreign decision unless it is opposed to our ethics, tradition and jurisprudence or otherwise unsuited to our conditions. Moreover, it is difficult, even though it may not be impossible, to administer the company law as it is now in force in India without the aid of the principles laid down by some of the leading English cases. [987 H: 988 A F] 932 Needle Industries (India) Ltd. and Ors. vs Needle Industries Neway (India) Holding Ltd. and Ors., ; , referred to. per Amarendra Nath Sen, J. (agreeing with Venkataramiah, J.) (i) If the right to participate in a winding up proceeding is to be judged from the view point of the interest of any party who may be prejudicially affected as a result of an order of winding up being made, it must logically follow that not only every employee of the company but also various other parties and persons who have trade relations or dealings with the company must necessarily be held to have the same right to be heard in such a proceeding; further, no suit for dissolution of a partnership can also be decided without impleading the employees of the firm and other parties having trade relations with the firm. [992 A E; 991 H] (ii) A company can only be wound up in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The right to have a company wound up is a right created by the statute. The entire proceeding in relation to the winding up is governed by the provisions of the Act and the Rules. The Act recognises that a company may go into liquidation without any intervention by the Court and also under the supervision of the court. Where the company goes into liquidation without reference to court, the employees of the company who have to meet the same fate of losing their employment cannot have any voice or say in the procedure to be adopted for liquidation of the company. [992 F G; 993 B C] (iii) The right of appearance and of being heard in a winding up proceeding has been conferred on persons whom the legislature considered to be necessary or proper parties for effective adjudication \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant company, Ramakrishna Industries (P) Limited (hereinafter referred to as a company) was a closed company in which there were two groups of shareholders, one group consisting of respondent Nos. 1 to 5 and the other consisting of respondents Nos. 7 to 14. Respondent Nos. 6 to 14 and the remaining 300 shares belong to a Trust in which both the groups are equally represented on the Board of Trustees. The dispute arose out of a petition for winding up of the company on two grounds set out in clauses (e) and (f) of section 433 of the. One ground was that the Company is unable to pay its debts, the other was that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up.

            "Target: After holding a departmental enquiry on certain charges of contravention of Government Servants ' Conduct Rules, the appellant was reduced in rank. His suit for a declaration that the impugned action was void and inoperative was dismissed. The High Court dismissed his appeal. On appeal, it was contended that the departmental enquiry was vitiated on account of material irregularities, and that, as a result of excessive delay, between the date of hearing and delivery of judgment by the High Court, it did not deal with a number of submissions made by him and thereby caused prejudice. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: (1)(a) The question whether the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity to lead evidence and was sufficiently heard or hot is largely a question of fact. It is only when an opportunity denied is of such a nature that the denial contravenes mandatory provision of law or a rule of natural justice that it could vitiate the whole departmental trial. Prejudice to the Government servant from an alleged violation of a rule must be proved.[583C] (b) The plea that the appellant had been subjected to trial on allegations which had been the subject matter of previous enquiries overlooks that no charge was framed as a result of any previous enquiry. If an enquiry was held at a particular stage, possibly to determine whether regular proceedings should be drawn up or started, it did not debar a departmental trial. [583D] State of Assam & Anr. vs J. N. Roy Biswas ; and R. T. Rangachari vs Secretary of State, AIR 1937 PC 27, held inapplicable. (c) It was not shown whether any evidence which the appellant tried to produce was really wrongly excluded and at what stage and for what reasons. All these are questions of fact which should be raised in the departmental trial. After that if there was any patent error a writ petition lay. [584A] (d) A suit challenging a departmental proceeding cannot be treated as an appeal from the findings in those proceedings or against a punishment inflicted upon the Government servant even if these were erroneous. A question which could affect the result in a civil suit has to be of such a nature that it goes to the root of the jurisdiction that the conduct of the departmental trial illegally and vitiates the result. It is only if the departmental proceeding is null and void that a plaintiff could obtain the reliefs he had asked for. [584E F] Smt. Ujjam Bai vs State of U.P. & Anr. [1963] 1 S.C.R. 778 @ 835, 836, referred to. (e) Unless a point could be raised on behalf of an appellant which is capable of vitiating the departmental proceedings there could be no declaration that the departmental proceedings were null and void. [585H] 581 (2) The Civil Procedure Code does not provide a time limit for the period between the hearing of arguments and the delivery of a judgment. Nevertheless, an unreasonable delay between the hearing of arguments and delivery of judgment, unless explained by exceptional or extraordinary circumstances, is highly undesirable even when written arguments were submitted. It is not unlikely that some points which the litigant considered important might have escaped notice. But, what is more important is that litigants must have complete confidence in the results of litigation. This confidence tends to be shaken if there excessive delay between hearing of arguments and delivery of judgments. \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant was originally appointed on 22nd November 1922, as Lower Division Clerk, and, thereafter, promoted as Income tax Inspector in 1942. He was promoted to the post of Income tax Officer in 1945. His case was that he had worked to the entire satisfaction of his immediate superior officers and higher authorities and had earned a number of certificates highly appreciative of his work. The appellant also claimed Rs. 20,904/ as arrears of salary, but he reduced this claim to Rs. 16,561.29. He also alleged that there had been an enquiry in 1949 into some of the matters mentioned in the charges, and about others in 1952 by Shri R. N. Srivastava, another Inspecting Commissioner, and that the appellant had been exonerated of the allegations and imputations made against him on each occasion. One of his defences was that a fresh enquiry into the same charges was not permissible under the Departmental rules and was also barred\n",

            "Target: The appellant firm had a number of factories including one at Kamptee in Vidharba. Its head office was also situated there,. The factory at Kamptee and the head office were treated as separate establishment. the factory being registered under the Factories Act and the Head Office under the C.P. and Berar Shops and Establishments Act, 1947. Respondent No. 1 was originally employed at the aforesaid factory but later he was directed to work at the head office. When the Head Office dismissed him from service he challenged the order of dismissal by an application under section 16 of the C.P. & Berar Industrial Disputes settlement Act. The Assistant Commissioner dismissed the application holding that Respondent No. 1 at the material time was not an employee of the factory but was employed in the Head Office. The Industrial Court refused, in revision, to interfere with the Assistant Commissioner 's order. Respondent No. 1 filed a writ petition under article 226 of the Constitution. The High Court observed that unless it was established that the employment of Respondent No. 1 in the factory was legally terminated it could be assumed merely because he was direct to work in the head office, that his employment was changed and the head office was substituted as his. employer in place of the said factory. , As the order passed by the Assistant Commissioner was not clear on this question the High Court remanded the case for disposal according to law. The firm appealed to this Court. HELD: (i) A contract for service is incapable of transfer unilaterally. Such a transfer of service from one employer to another can only be effected by a tripartite agreement between the employer, the employee and the third party, the effect of which would be to terminate the original contract of service by mutual consent and to. make a new contract between the employee and the third party. So long as the contract of service is not terminated, a new contract is not made as aforesaid, and the employee continues to be in the employment of the employer. Therefore, when an employer orders him to: do certain work for another person the employee still continues to be i.n his employment. The only thing that happens in such a case is that he carries out the orders of his master. employee has the right to claim his wages from the employer and not from the third party to whom his services are lent or hired. It may be that such a third party may pay his wages during the time that he has hired his services, but that is because of his agreement with the employer. that does not preclude the employee from claiming his wages from the employer. the hirer may also. exercise control and direction in the doing of the thing for which he is hired or even the manner in which it is to be done. But if the employee fails to. carry out his direction he cannot 273 dismiss him and can only complain to the employee. The 'right of dismissal vests with the employer. [279 &F] Such being the position in law, in the present case the High Court was right in setting aside the order of the Assistant Commissioner and the Industrial Court on the ground that unless a finding was reached on the facts of the case that the contract of service with the said factory came to an end and a fresh contract with the head office came into being, Respondent No. 1 continued to be in the employment of the factory and the head office therefore was not competent to dismiss him.

            "Target: Two officers of the appellant were assaulted by the workmen. In this connection the appellant served notices on eight workmen calling upon them to explain their conduct and to show cause why they should not be dismissed. In their explanations the workmen denied the charges. Thereupon a proper enquiry was held according to the Standing Orders, as a result of which the charges were found proved against the workmen and the appellant dismissed the workmen and asked them to take their final dues together with one month 's pay in lieu of notice. As a dispute in respect of bonus was pending before the Industrial Tribunal, the appellant made applications to it under section 6E(2) of the U. P. , for approval of the dismissal of the workmen. The Tribunal refused to accord its approval and directed the appellant to reinstate the workmen from the date of suspension and to pay full wages for the period of unemployment. The appellant contended that the Tribunal acted beyond its jurisdiction and assumed powers of an appellate Court over the decision of the appellant. Held, that the Tribunal had assumed jurisdiction not vested in it by assuming powers of an appellate Court and its refusal to accord approval was patently erroneous in law. The requirement of obtaining approval under section 6E(2)(b) of the U. P. Act (or section 33(2) Of the Central Act) in cases of dismissal or discharge for misconduct not connected with a pending dispute as distinguished from the requirement of obtaining previous permission under section 6E(1) of '.the U. P. Act (or section 33(1) of the Central Act) in cases of misconduct connected with a pending dispute indicated that the ban imposed by section 6E(2) was not as rigid or rigorous as that imposed by section 6E(1). The jurisdiction to give or withhold permission was Prima facie wider than the jurisdiction to give or withhold approval. Where the employer had held a proper domestic enquiry and had dismissed the workmen as a result of such enquiry, all that the Tribunal could do was to enquire: (i) whether the Standing Orders justified the dismissal, (ii) whether the enquiry had been held as provided by the Standing Orders, (iii) whether wages for one month had been paid and (iv) whether an application for approval had been made as prescribed. In the present case all these conditions were 205 satisfied but the Tribunal lost sight of its limitations and assumed powers of an appellate Court entitled to go into question of fact.

Sub section (1) of section 245D requires the Set tlement Commission, as and when such an application is made to call for a report from the Commissioner of Income Tax. The first proviso thereto interdicts rejection of the appli cation under that sub section unless an opportunity has been given to the applicant of being heard. The second proviso thereto provides that no application shall be proceeded with under that sub section if the Commissioner objects to the same on the ground that concealment of particulars of income on the part of the applicant or perpetration of fraud by him for evading any tax has been established or is likely to be established. Sub section (IA) inserted in section 245D by the Finance Act, 1979 empowered the Settlement Commission to overrule the objections of the Commissioner. The appellant made a composite application under section 245C of the Act for settlement of his assessments for the assessment years 1948 49 to 1975 76. The Commissioner ob jected to the proposals under sec 336 tion 245D(1) for settlement for the years 1948 49 to 1959 60, but agreed to the settlement for the later years. The Commission accordingly made an order an 24th August, 1977 rejecting the application for settlement for the years 1948 49 to 1959 60. The appellant thereupon applied to the Commission to recall its order since the same had been made without furnishing him any opportunity of hearing. That application was pending. When sub section (IA) was inserted to section 245D, the appellant applied to the Commission to permit him to contest the objections of the Commissioner contending that these should be dealt with in accordance with the amended provisions of section 245D(IA). On 7th August, 1987 the Settlement Commission accepted the first part of the contentions holding that the applicant was entitled to a re hearing since its order of 24th August, 1977 had been made in violation of the principles of natural justice and also express provision of section 245D(1) provi so, but rejected the second part of the submission on the view that the application for settlement would have to be disposed of in accordance with law which prevailed on 24th August, 1977. It further held that since the Commissioner had objected only to some of the years under settlement the entire application would have to be rejected. Allowing the appeal by Special Leave, HELD: 1. It is necessary as a concomitant of the fulfil ment of natural justice that an applicant before the Settle ment Commission should be heard before his application under Section 245C of the Act is rejected. The order made by the Commission on 24th August, 1977 in the instant case in violation of the principles of natural justice was, there fore, of no value. If that is so, then the application made for settlement was still pending before the Commission when the amendment made by the Finance Act of 1979 came into effect and the said amendment being procedural, it would govern the pending proceedings and the Commission would have the power to overrule the objections of the Commissioner.

Relying on the evidence furnished by entries in the books of account of some other dealers, the Sales Tax Officer disbelieved the assessee 's accounts and came to the conclusion that the return field by him was incorrect and incomplete and made a best judgment assessment under section 17(3). The assessee 's request to cross examine the deal ers in regard to the correctness of their accounts was rejected by the Sales Tax Officer. In revision the High Court quashed the order of the Sales Tax Officer. Dismissing the State 's appeal, (Per Bhagwati and Sarkaria. JJ) HELD . The assessee was entitled to cross examine the dealers under the second part of the proviso to section 17(3). The Sales Tax Officer 's refusal to summon the dealers for cross examination by the. assessee constituted infraction of the right conferred on the assessee by the second part of the proviso and that vitiated the order of assessment made against him. [239 F] (1) The rule which requires an opportunity to be heard to be given to a person likely to be affected by a decision is not an inflexible rule having a fixed connotation. It has a variable content depending on the nature of the in quiry, the framework of the law under which it is held, the constitution of the authority holding the inquiry, the nature and character of the right affected and the coil sequences flowing from the decision. The rule of audi alterem partem does not require in every case a specified procedure to be followed. In a given case, the rule of audi alterem partem may import a requirement that witnesses, whose statements are sought to be relied upon by the author ity holding the inquiry, should be permitted to be cross examined by the party affected while in some other cases it may not. The procedure required to be adopted for giving an opportunity to a person to be heard must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. [237 B D] (2) (a) It is only on the existence of one of two condi tions, namely, that no return is .submitted by the assessee or the return submitted appears to be incorrect or incom plete that the Sales Tax Officer gets the jurisdiction to make a best judgment assessment. [237 H] 234 (b) The second part of the proviso lays down that where a return has been submitted, the assessee should be given a reasonable opportunity to prove the correctness or complete ness of such return. \"To prove\" means to establish the correctness or completeness of the return by any mode per missible under law. The opportunity to prove would, there fore, necessarily carry with it the right to examine wit nesses and that would include equally the right to cross examine witnesses examined by the Sales Tax Officer. [238 G H] In the instant case, the assessee could prove the cor rectness and completness of his return only by showing that the entries in the books of account of the dealers on which the Sales Tax Officer relied, were false, bogus or manipu lated and that his return should not be disbelieved on the basis of such entries. This could not be done unless an opportunity to cross examine the dealers was given. [239 B] Murlimohan Prabhudayal vs State of Orissa, 26 S.T.C. 22 and M. Appukutty vs State of Kerala, 14 S.T.C. 489 approved. Fazal Ali, J. (concurring). Section 17(3) with the proviso thereto and r. 15, have given a statutory right to the assessee to prove the cor rectness of his return and the assessee was entitled to cross examine the wholesale dealers, relying on whose ac counts the Sales Tax Officer made a best judgment assess ment. [247 E] (1) The well settled rules in regard to best judgment assessment are (i) The taxing authority must not act dis honestly or vindictively or capriciously. He must make what he honestly believes to be a fair estimate, of the proper figures of assessment and for this purpose, he must be able to take into consideration all matters which he thinks will assist him in arriving at a fair and proper estimate. Though it must necessarily be guess work it must be honest guess work. [241 E] (ii) Although tax proceedings are quasi judicial and the Sales Tax Officer is not bound strictly by rules of evi dence, yet he must base his order on materials known to the assessee and after he has been given a chance to rebut the same. [244 E] (iii) Admissibility of a document or material in evi dence is quite different from the value which the authority would attach to such material. The tax authority can even base its conclusion on private opinion or assessment provid ed the same is fully disclosed to the assessee and he is given an opportunity to rebut the same. [242 E] Income tax Commissioner vs Badridas Ramrai Shop, Akola (1937) 64 I.A. 102, 114, 115 and Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. vs Commissioner of Incometax, West Bengal, ; followed. Raghubar Mandal Harihar Mandal vs State of Bihar 8 S.T.C. 770 and C. Vasantilal & Co. vs C.I.T. Bombay City 45/.T.R. 206 referred to. Seth Gurmukh Singh vs Commissioner of Income tax Punjab, approved, 2(a) The words \"opportunity of being heard\" in section 17(3) are of very wide amplitude. All that the court has. to see is whether the assessee had been given a fair hearing. Whether the hearing would extend to the right of demanding cross examination of witnesses or not, would depend upon the nature of the materials relied upon by the tax authorities, the manner in which the assessee can rebut those materials and the facts and circumstances of each case. [234F G] 235 The second part of the proviso confers benefit on the asses see for giving him an opportunity not only of being heard but also of proving the correctness or completeness of his return. Secondly, r. 15 clearly shows that where the return of the assessee is incorrect or incomplete he must be called upon to prove. the correctness or completeness of the same. It also enjoins on the Sales Tax Officer that a reasonable opportunity of being heard should be given to the assessee to prove the correctness and completeness of the return. The requirement of the second part of the proviso to section 17(3) is reiterated in r. 15. D] In the instant case, if the assessee desired the dealers whose accounts were used against him to be cross examined to prove that his return was not incorrect or incomplete, he could not be denied this opportunity. The dealers might have made the entries to embarrass the assessee or they might have animus or business rivalry with the assessee. The assessee could establish the correctness of his return only if he was allowed to cross examine the dealers. [244 H] Jayantilal Thakordas vs State of Gujarat 23 S.T.C. 11 dis tinguished. M.

            "Prediction: In the assessment of the assessee to sales tax for three assessment years, certain sales appearing in the books of account of one Haji P.K. Usmankutty as having been effected by the assesse in his favour were not accounted for. The assessee applied to the Sales Tax Officer for affording him an oppor tunity to cross examine him in regard to the correctness of his accounts, but this opportunity was denied to him and the sales Tax Officer proceeded to make a best judgment assessment under section 17, sub section (3) of the Kerala General Sales Tax, 1963. The High Court quashed the orders of the sales tax authorities for making fresh assessments according to law. The State preferred an appeal by special leave in each case challenging the correctness Of the view taken by the High Court. In the appeals to this Court, it was well settled that tax authorities entrusted with the power to make assessment of tax discharge quasi judicial functions and they are bound to observe principles\n",

            "Target: The appellants were prosecuted for committing offences under section 16(1)(a)(i) read with section 7 of the . After some evidence was led on behalf of the prosecution, plea bargaining took place between the prosecution, the accused and the Magistrate. The accused pleaded guilty which plea was accepted by the Magistrate. The accused were accordingly convicted and sentenced to undergo imprisonment till the rising of the Court and to pay a small fine. The High Court initiated suo motu proceeding in revision. The accused appeared and challenged the convictions recorded against them, but the High Court did not go into the circumstances in which the plea of guilty was entered, enhanced the sentences imposed on them to three months ' simple imprisonment and fine. Allowing the appeals, ^ HELD: 1. A conviction based on the plea of guilty entered by the accused as a result of plea bargaining cannot be sustained. [1041E] 2. The High Court was clearly in error in not setting aside the conviction and sending the case back to the Magistrate for trial in accordance with law, ignoring the plea of guilty entered by the appellants. [1041F] 3. The Magistrate trying an accused for a serious offence like adulteration must apply his mind to the evidence recorded before him and, on the facts as they emerge from the evidence, decide whether the accused is guilty or not. [1040B] In the instant case the Magistrate had got a cyclostyled form of judgment in which merely blanks were filled in by him. This clearly indicates that the Magistrate was in the habit of encouraging plea bargaining and letting off the accused lightly if there was a plea of guilty, enabling quick disposal without any effort. This was a highly reprehensible practice. The High Court had expressed strong disapproval of it. [1039H 1040A] 4. (i) It is highly regrettable that the prosecution as well as the Magistrate should have been a party to any plea bargaining in a prosecution for adulteration involving the health and well being of the community. Adulteration has 1038 assumed alarming proportions and it is essential to wipe it out ruthlessly and completely by bringing to book offenders responsible for adulteration resulting in ruination of the health of the people. The investigating agencies must intensify their efforts and catch hold of those who for private economic gain are prepared to jeopardize the health of the community. When such persons are arraigned before the Court and found guilty a deterrent and punitive sentence must be imposed upon them. [1039E G] (ii) If it is possible to get away with a light sentence in respect of an offence of adulteration the anti adulteration law will cease to have any meaning and validity. [1039H] 5. Administration of justice is a sacred task and partakes of the divine function. It is with the greatest sense of responsibility and anxiety that the judicial officer must discharge his judicial function, particularly when it concerns the liberty of a persons. [1040C] 6. It would be contrary to public policy to allow a conviction to be recorded against an accused by inducing him to confess to a plea of guilty on an allurement being held out to him that if he enters a plea of guilty, he will be let off very lightly. Such a procedure would be clearly unreasonable, unfair and unjust and would be violative of article 21 of the Constitution. It would have the effect of polluting the pure fount of justice because it might induce an innocent accused to plead guilty to suffer a light and inconsequential punishment rather than go through a long and ardous criminal trial. The judge also might be likely to be defected from the path of duty to do justice and he might either convict an innocent accused by accepting the plea of guilty or let of a guilty accused with a light sentence, thus, subverting the process of low and frustrating the social objective and purpose of the anti adulteration statute. This practice would also tend to encourage corruption and collusion and as a direct consequence, contribute to the lowering of the standard of justice. [1041B E] \n",

            "Target: The appellant company executed .a Loan and Note Purchase Agreement with a foreign bank. Under that agreement the appellant was to authorise the creation and issuance of secured notes, Series A and B, and the Notes were to be issued under and secured by a Deed of Trust and Mortgage between the Company and the Bank. The Deed of Trust and Mortgage stated that as the appellant was in the process of constructing a refinery for the refining of crude oil and deemed it necessary to borrow money from time to time to finance such construction and to issue its Notes therefor, and to mortgage and charge its properties to secure the payment of such Notes, it executed the Deed of Trust and Mortgage as Security in accordance with the terms and condi tions of Article 2 of the Deed of Trust and Mortgage to secure the due payment of the principal and the premium, if any, and the interest on the Notes, and of all other monies for the time being and from time to time owing on the security of the indenture and on the Notes and the perform ance by the Company of all of its obligations thereunder. It was also agreed that the Notes shall be secured and shall have the other terms and conditions provided in the agree ment and shall be guaranteed by the President of India pursuant to the terms of the Guarantee Agreement. The Guarantee Agreement state. that the President of India, as the guarantor, unconditionally guaranteed as primary obligor and not as surety merely, the due and .punctual payment from time to time of the principal as well as interest stated m the Agreement. The obligations of the guarantor were abso lute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and were not be to any extent or in any way discharged, impaired or otherwise affected, except by performance thereof in accordance with the terms thereof. It was also provided that each and every remedy of the Trustee shall be cumula tive and shall be in addition to any other remedy given therein or under the mortgage or any of the other collateral or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. The Guarantee Agreement was executed on the same day as the Deed of Trust and Mortgage between the President of India and the foreign bank as a Trustee. The High Court decided that stamp duty was chargeable on the Trust and Mortgage Deed under article 40(b) of Schedule I to the Act. In appeal to this Court it was contended that it was the Guarantee Agreement which was the principal and primary security and that the Deed of Trust and Mortgage was a collateral or auxillary security and as such stamp duty was payable under article 40(c) and that the Guarantee Agreement was exempt from duty under section 3 and debentures under article 27. Dismissing the Appeal, HELD: (1) It is the real and true meaning of the deed of Trust and Mortgage and the Guarantee Agreement which has to be ascertained irrespective of the description given by the parties. [568 E] (2) The Trust and Mortgage Deed was executed before the execution of the Guarantee Agreement though both of them were executed on the same day. It was the Deed of Trust and Mortgage which was the security for the 566 loan though the loan was also guaranteed by the President in terms of the Guarantee Agreement. [568 G H] (3) The. terms and conditions of the Guarantee Agreement cannot detract from the basic fact that the Deed of Trust and Mortgage was executed first in point of time and was the principal or the primary security for the loan. The Deed of Trust and Mortgage was clearly the principal or the pri mary security and could not be said to be a collateral agreement. [569 H] (4) The Deed of Trust clearly stated that the terms \"Collateral Agreements\" shall mean the Guarantee Agreement and the Undertaking. [570 A B] (5) The Guarantee Agreement was not an instrument of sale, mortgage or settlement and did not fall within the purview of section 4(1) of the Act. [571 E.F] (6) There is no justification for the contention that the debentures were the principal instruments and not the Deed of Trust and Mortgage. The secured notes were issued under and secured by the Deed of Trust and Mortgage. The notes were issued in consequence of and on the security of the Deed of Trust and Mortgage. [571 H, 572 A] \n",

            "Target: In an election to a Parliamentary constituency, having 2,19,554 voters 1,20,008 votes were polled. of these 4,168 votes were declared invalid. The appellant won by securing 1,541 votes more than the next candidate the respondent. The respondent filed an election petition on the ground that the polling was disturbed as the polling centres were in some cases changed without due notification, at some polling stations almost no votes were cast because of fi 'ring at rioters and at some polling stations the polling hours were reduced. Only 1,894 votes were polled at these polling booths, in which the total number of voters attached were 8,620. so 6,726 voters could not vote. The Judicial Commissioner ordered fresh poll in these polling stations. In appeal by the returned candidate, this Court. HELD: The appeal must succeed. The decision of the Judicial Commissioner that the election was in contravention of the Act and the Rules was correct in the circumstances this case but that did not alter the position with regard to section 100(1)(d) (iv) of the Representation of the People Act. That section requires that the election petitioner must go a little further and prove that the result of the election had been materially affected. And in this case this burden had not been discharged. [643 F] The evidence in this case which had been brought by the election 'petitioner was the kind of evidence which was criticised by this Court. Witnesses were brought forward to state that a number of voters did not vote because of the change of venue or because of firing and that they had already decided to vote en bloc for the election petitioner. This kind of evidence was merely an assertion on the part of a witness, who could not speak 'for 500 voters for the simple reason that as this Court said the casting of votes at an election depends upon a variety of factors and it is not possible for anyone to predicate how many or which proportion of votes wilt go to one or the other candidates. This conclusion is further forified if one examines the polling pattern in this election. Not more than 55% of the voters cast their votes. !This immediately cut down the ' figure of 6,726 to a little over half and the margin from which the election petitioner could claim additional votes therefore becomes exceedingly small. From the pattern of voting as was disclosed at the various polling booths to which the voters had gone, it was clear, that 1,541 votes could not. by any reasonable guess, have been taken off from the lead of the returned candidates so as to make the election petitioner successful. 'In ,so far as the other contesting candidates were concerned, they had received so few votes that even if they had received all the votes that had not been cast, it would have mattered little to the result of the election. The Judicial Commissioner reached his conclusion by committing the same error which was criticised in Vashist Narain Sharmas case. He took the statement of witnesses at their word and held on the basis of 638 these statements that all the votes that had not been cast would have gone to the election petitioner.

The appellant contended that the polling hours at some polling stations were reduced with the result that some of the voters who went to the polling station were unable to cast their votes. The Judicial Commissioner's Court, however, held that the poll was disturbed because of numerous circumstances.

Certain properties were acquired thereafter for the joint family. Certain properties were also acquired in the name of the first respondent 's son his wife and grandson. The two other brothers of respondent No. 1 acquired properties for themselves out of their own earnings. Relations became strained between the brothers and the second brother the present appellant filed suit for partition claiming not only the original properties of the joint family and the properties acquired for the joint family by the Karta, the present respondent but also the properties acquired by the respondent No. 1 in the name of his wife, son and grandson as joint family properties. He also called on the first respondent to account for the past years. The third brother was impleaded as second defendant. Respondent No. 1 's contention was that the last mentioned properties were bought by him from his own savings and therefore were not part of the join, family property and consequently not liable to partition. The learned trial Judge held that those properties were joint family property and were liable to be partitioned. Respondent No. 1 thereupon appealed to the High Court and the High Court allowed the appeal regarding substantial part of the schedule properties. Thereupon the appellant filed the present appeal. Held: (i) Where properties were acquired in the name of a joint family member, if at the date of such acquisition the joint family had sufficient nucleus for acquiring it, the property should be presumed to have been acquired from out of family funds and so to form part of the joint family property, unless the contrary is shown. In the present case on a consideration of the evidence it is found that the joint family had at the date of the acquisition Of the properties in question sufficient nucleus from which these properties could be acquired.

(ii) In the absence of any evidence of fraud or misrepresentation the Karta of a joint family cannot be called upon to account for the past transactions, but this does net mean that the parties were bound to accept the statement of the Karta as to what the property consisted of and an enquiry should be directed by the court in a manner usually adopted to discover that in fact the property consisted of at the date of the partition. In what manner this principle can be applied depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Where as in the present case the evidence ,on record shows prima facie that the Karta could not reasonably 491 be expected to have in his hands at the date of the suit any accumulaties found on evidence to have been acquired by the family, there can be no justification for calling the Karta to account for his past dealing with the joint family property and its income.

The appellants challenged the validity of thenotification in the High Court contending that the notification unders. 6 of the Act did not describe the land to be acquired with sufficient particularity and that although the notification mentioned that the land was required for a public purpose, in fact it was required for a company, which was entirely different from Government and was therefore invalid. Soon after the writ petition was filed, the State Government issued a fresh notification on April 19. 1961 mainly under section 17(1) read with section 17(4) of the Act. The notification stated that it was declared under section 6 of the Act that the land was required for a public purpose, namely, \"for the Premier Refractory Factory and work connected therewith. \" At the time of hearing of the writ petition in the High Court, it was urged on behalf of the appellants that both the notifications under section 6 of the December 3, 1960 and April 19. 637 1961 were invalid because the acquisition was not for a public purpose as stated therein; in fact it was for a company which was entirely different from Government. The High Court dismissed the writ petition and held that the notifications under section 6 must in substance and in law be demed to be for acquisition of land for a company in the present case. Held: Where the 'entire compensation is to be paid by a company. the notification under section 6 must contain a declaration that the land is needed for a company. No notification under section 6 can be made where the entire compensation is to be paid by a company declaring that the acquisition is for a public purpose, for, such a declaration requires that either wholly or in part, compensation must come out of public revenues ,or some fund controlled or managed by a local authority. Pandif Jhandu Lal vs State of Punjab, ; , followed. In the present case, the whole compensation was to be paid by the company, therefore the notification under section 6 had to declare that the land was needed for a company. There was nothing in either of the two notifications of December 3, 1960 and April 19, 1961 to show that the land was needed for a company, therefore they were invalid in view of the proviso to section 6 (1) of the Act and all proceedings following on such notifications would be of no effect under the Act. \n",

In 1955 by an amending Act, section 202 was substituted by another section and, by sub s.(1) of section 202 it was enacted : \"no person shall act as an agent for the transaction of any business relating to the entrance or clearance of vessel or the import or export of goods or baggage in any custom house unless such person hold '$ a licence granted in this behalf in accordance with the rules made under sub section (2) \". By sub section (2) the Chief Customs authority was empowered to make rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the section. Section 4 provided that \"when any person was . authorised by the owner of the goods to be his agent in respect of such goods for all or any of the purpose, of thisAct. such person shall for such purposes be deemed to be the owner of such goods\". The petitioners who, after the enactment of the news.202, had to apply for licences to be granted in accordance with 'the rules framed under sub s(2), challenged the validity of certain of the rules on the ground that they contravened articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution of India and also that they were in excess of the rule making power conferred by s.202 (2). In particular, they questioned power validity or r. 12 under which inter alia the agent was required to enter into a bond in Form C by which he was made liable for short collection of customs duty under section 39 and also to furnish security which might be increased or decreased by the Customs collector. Held : (1) that the rules in question though they were headed as framed under section 202 of the , cannot be impugned on the ground that some of them go beyond the special purposes of that section and seek to further some of the general purposes of other parts of the Act, since the Chief Customs authority is also empowered under section 9 of the Act to make. rules consistent with the Act \"generally to carry out the provisions of the Act.\" (2) that rr. 4 and 8 under which the Customs collector could limit the number of licences to be granted at the Customs House and applications could only be made if the Customscollector published a notice inviting applications, do not contravene article 19 of the Constitution, as they are only designed to advance public interest.

(5) that r. 10 (1)(c) which gives the Customs collector a wide discretion to reject an application for the grant of a licence, if he considers the applicant to be not suitable, is an unreasonable restriction upon the right of the successful candidate to carry on his avocation, and is invalid. If a candidate is found fit under the other rules and has successfully passed the examination, he should only be rejected under a rule which requires the Customs collector to state his reasons for the rejection, and the rules must provide for an appeal against the order. (6) that r. 11, in so far as it prescribes a renewal fee of Rs. 50,is invalid inasmuch as it has thereby provided not for a fee but for a tax to raise revenue.

            "Target: The appellant entered into an agreement with the respondent to purchase African raw cotton. The agreement included a clause that the contract would be subject to the \" usual Force Majeure clause \", the Bye laws of East India Cotton Association Ltd., Bombay, except bye law 35, the said Bye laws having statutory force, and to the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court. Clause 6 of the agreement provided that the buyers were to obtain import licence from the Government of India, failing which the seller would be entitled either to carry over the goods at the cost of the buyers or call upon them to take immediate delivery on payment in British East Africa, and in default to sell the goods in British East Africa and claim the deficit, if any between the contractual price and the price obtained on re sale. Clause 7 further provided that notwithstanding the import policy followed by the Government of India in respect of the import of the contracted goods, the buyers would be bound to obtain the necessary import licences and communicate the numbers thereof to the sellers on specified dates, failing which cl. 6 would operate. The buyers did not perform the contract and the sellers after notice to them re sold the goods and thereafter claimed the deficit which the,buyers refused to pay. The sellers invoked the arbitration clause and the rules contained in bye law 38A of the Bye laws and others following it, which conferred on the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the East India Cotton Association Ltd., the power of selecting the arbitrator or arbitrators, and applied to the High Court under section 20 of the Indian for filing the agreement and referring the dispute to arbitration. The buyers resisted and the trial judge dismissed the application, but the Court of appeal reversed that decision. It was urged in this Court on behalf of the buyers that (1) cls. 6 and 7 contemplated acquisition of property or Exchange in Africa and thus involved a breach of section 5 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, since no general or special exemption had been granted thereunder by the Reserve Bank, (2) that the expression \" subject to the usual Force Majeure clause \" was vague and uncertain and rendered the agreement void, (3) that the application of bye law 48A et seq left no powers in the Court to act under sub sections (1) and (4) of section 20n 1021 of the and the section was thus inapplicable and (4) that the law applicable to the case was the law of British East Africa and not that of India. Held, that the contentions must fail. The provisions of sub sections (2) and (3) of section 21 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, properly construed, left no manner of doubt that they contemplated matters which were within the prohibition of section 5 of the Act and had the effect of engrafting on the agreement of parties a term that it would be for the decreeholder before he could enforce the decree or order of the court to obtain the permission of the Reserve Bank and were thus designed to prevent the non performance of the contract under a cover of illegality. The contract involved no actual or contingent right to acquisition of property abroad, and even assuming it did, it was saved by section 21 of the Act subject to its conditions. The agreement was thus enforceable. Nor was the contract void for uncertainty. It was clear from judicial decisions that a reference to \"force majeure \" means the saving of the performing party from the consequence of factors beyond his control. The condition in respect of \"force majeure \" did not, therefore\" make the contract vague. Further, the use of the word \" usual \" made it clear that the clause could be made certain by evidence and so it was protected by section 29 of the Contract Act.

Although by section 46 of the , the Bye laws, if inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, must prevail, it was not correct to say that their application made the Courtfunctus officio under section 20 of the Act. It must not be overlooked that although the present was a case of statutory arbitration governed by its own rules, the court under section 20(4) of the had two distinct powers, (1) of judicially considering whether or not the arbitration agreement should be filed in court and (2) whether there should be a reference to the arbitrator or arbitrators appointed by the parties or selected by it. Since in the instant case the parties had by their agreement empowered the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the East India Cotton Association, Ltd., to select the arbitrator or arbitrators, the court could send the agreement to him to be dealt with under the pro, cedure laid by the said Bye laws. 1022 Whether the law of the country where the contract is made or of the country where it is to be performed should apply is sometimes a matter of presumption. But the declared intention of the parties overrides such presumption. Where there is no such declaration, the intention may be inferred from the terms and nature of the contract and the general circumstances of the case. In the instant case, since the parties agreed that in case of dispute the Bombay High Court would have jurisdiction and the arbitration clause indicated arbitration in India, there could be no doubt that the Indian law was to apply.

In each of these cases the assessee preferred an appeal to the first appellate authority and moved an application for the waiver of any deposit of the tax which was necessary before the appeal could be entertained.

The Tribunal in all the three cases directed the assessee to pay 10% of the assessed tax before the appeal could be enter tained. Each of the assessees preferred a revision petition before the High Court.

This Court while dismissing the appeals made it clear that it did not agree with the High Court 's interpretation of the statutory provisions and, HELD: The provision in question makes two relaxations.

            "Target: The appellants migrated to India in 1947 from West Pakistan. To begin with, they were given temporary allotment of land in two villages. In 1949, land was allotted to them on quasi permanent basis, and they have remained in possession of the same eversince. Originally, land was classified into two kinds: urban and agricultural land. Later on, a third classification was introduced, known as sub urban land. The two villages in which land was allotted to the appellants were not included in the notification with respect to sub urban land. In February, 1952, the Director of Rehabilitation passed and order declaring those villages as 734 sub urban land. The result of the order was that the allotment made to the appellants was to be reduced. The appellants went in revision to the Custodian General, and their revision petitions were dismissed on the ground that the view of Rule 14(6)(iii)(d) of the Rule it was open to the Central Government by a special order to direct cancellation or variation of the allotment made in favour of the appellants, and the Central Government has on the representation of the Punjab Government agreed to declare the two villages in question as sub urban by its order dated October 11, 1955. The appellants filed a writ petition in the High Court but that was dismissed summarily. The have come in appeal to this Court by special leave. ^ Held, that when the notification of March 24, 1955, was made under section 12 of the placed Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954, the evacuee property in those villages ceased to be evacuee property and became a part of the compensation pool. That property could only be dealt with under the Act of 1954. If any variation or cancellation of allotment was to he made that could be done only under the provisions of section 19 of Act of 1954. There was no power left in the Central Government to act under Rule 14(6)(iii)(d) of the Rules framed under the with respect to that land after the notification of March 24, 1955.

            "Target: Item 14 E of the First Schedule to the at the relevant time dealt with patent or proprietary medicines not containing alcohol, opium, Indian hemp or other narcotic drugs or narcotics. Explanation I thereto defined 'patent or proprietary medicines ' to mean any drug or medicinal preparation, in whatever form, for use in the internal or external treatment of, or for the preven tion of ailments In human beings or animals. Item 68 dealt with all other goods, not elsewhere specified but excluding alcohol, opium, Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics. The Central Government by a notification dated February 28, 1982 exempted certain goods falling under Item 68 from the levy of central excise duty. Entry at section No. 10 in the schedule annexed thereto read \"animal feed including com pound livestock feed\". The said notification was superseded by notification dated November 1, 1982 which also provided the same exemption. This notification was again amended by notification dated February 15, 1984. Entry at section No. 10 in the schedule thereto read \"animal feed including compound livestock feed, animal feed supplement and animal feed concentrates\". A question arose as to whether Bifuran Supplement, Neftin 50 and Neftin 200 manufactured by the appellant were chargeable to excise duty as patent or proprietary medicines under Item 14 E or could be classified as \"animal feed supplement\" under Item 68 and exempted from payment of excise duty. The Assistant Collector of Central Excise held that the said formulations were classifiable under Tariff Item 14 E. His order was, however, set aside by the Collec tor of Central Excise (Appeals) who held that the said products were animal feed supplements which merited classi fication only under the erstwhile Tariff Item 68 and not under Tariff Item 14 E. On appeal by the Department, the Tribunal held that the aforesaid three products manufactured by the 443 appellant were patent and 'proprietary medicines as defined in Tariff Item 14 E inasmuch as they have therapeutic and preventive use in respect of the specific ailments in ani mals, that if the products satisfied the requirements of Tariff Item 14 E there was no question of considering their classification under Tariff Item 68 which was a residuary item. In this appeal under section 35 L of the Act it was stated on behalf of the appellant that since the use of Bifuran Sup plement was to promote growth rate, weight gains and feed conversion efficiency in growers and broilers by keeping coccidiosis away during growing period, it could be regarded as a preventive medicine falling under Tariff Item 14 E. However, in respect of Neftin 50 and Neftin 200 it was urged that these were manufactured for use as animal feed supple ment and not for use as medicines and, therefore, they should have been classified as animal feed supplement under Tariff Item 68 and exempted from payment of excise duty under notification dated February 15, 1984. It was further contended that the appellant had been subjected to arbitrary and hostile discrimination as similar products of other manufacturers were being exempted from payment of excise duty under the said notification. For the respondent it was contended that Neftin 50 contains Furazolidone 5% w/w and Neftin 200 contains Furazolidone 20% w/w, that Furazolidone is used as an aid in the prevention of coccidiosis as well as for treatment of coccidiosis, that Furazolidone is a patent drug and in England it is sold to the public on the prescription of a registered practitioner only that the finding that these two products were patent and proprietary medicines failing under Tariff Item 14 E was essentially a finding of fact based on the materials placed before the excise authorities and the said finding was not normally open to challenge in appeal, that the other manufacturers whose products were exempted were located at different places and were assessable to excise duty by different authorities, and that the relevant notifications have been wrongly applied to those manufacturers by the concerned authorities. Dismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1. Item 68 of the Excise Tariff was a residuary entry which dealt with all other goods not elsewhere speci fied. A product which is found to be covered by the other items of the Schedule of the Excise Tariff would be outside the ambit of Item 68. [260F] Dunlop India Ltd. vs Union of India & Ors., ; and Collector of Central Excise, Kanpur vs Krishna Carbon Paper Co., ; , referred to. 444 2. What is required for purposes of Item 14 E is that the product must be a preparation for use in the treatment or prevention of ailments in human beings or animals. Furaz olidone is an antibacterial, antifungal and antiprotozoal compound. It is used for prevention and treatment of coccid iosis as well as histomoniasis in poultry. In England it.is a veterinary drug and it can be sold or supplied to the public on a practitioner 's prescription only. Furazolidone is thus a drug or medicinal preparation used for treatment and prevention of ailments in poultry. Since Neftin 50 and Neftin 200 contain only Furazolidone, the said products are also drugs or medicinal preparations for use in the treat ment and prevention of ailments in poultry. They have, therefore, to be regarded as patent and proprietary medi cines chargeable to excise duty under Item No. 14 E. [262E G] Annapurna Carbon Industries Co. vs State of A.P ; , referred to. The exemption under notification dated November 1, 1982, as amended by notification dated February 15, 1984 was confined in its application to specified goods which fell under Item 68. The said notification did not grant exemption in respect of a product failing in any other entry 'of the excise tariff. It could not be construed as transferring a product from an entry other than Item 68 to Item 68. The insertion of 'animal feed supplement ' in Entry No. 10 in the schedule to the notification dated November 1, 1982 by the notification dated February 15, 1984, would not mean that a product which was liable to payment of excise duty under Item 14 E prior to such insertion would cease to be so liable and would become exempt from such payment of duty by virtue of that notification. Prior to the notification dated February 15, 1984, the appellant was paying excise duty on Neftin 50 and Neftin 200 as patent and proprietary medicines failing under Item 14 E. In the absence of any notification granting exemption in respect of products falling under Item 14 E, Neftin 50 and Neftin 200 could not be claimed to be exempt from Central Excise duty as animal feed supplement. [263F H; 264A B] 4. It was not the case of the appellant that the same authority had passed orders discriminating between the appellant and other producers of similar products. Nor it is said that there has been intentional and systematic discrim ination in favour of the producers other than the appellant. The discrimination complained of arose on account of orders passed by different excise authorities acting quasi judi cially. Merely because on account of difference in the interpretation of the relevant notifications by the excise authorities in other regions other manufac 445 turers of similar products in those regions were enjoying exemption from payment of such duty the same exemption could not be extended to it. The appellant could not obtain such an exemption in disregard of the law by invoking the right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution.

An enquiry was conducted against the petitioner, but later it was cancelled and a fresh enquiry was commenced on the charges that he allowed a Santry to leave the santry post without arranging proper relief resulting in the escape of 2 undertrial prisoners; that he did not take immediate action to report the matter to the Head Quarters; that he connived the escape of the two undertrial prisoners; that he dug up a tunnel to make it appear that the two undertrial prisoners escaped through the tunnel and that he did not hand over the guard duty roster thus preventing its production as evidence. Statement of some witnesses and that of the Petitioner were recorded. Only one defence witness was examined. The Enquiry Officer submitted his report recommending disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner. On the basis of the Report , a dismissal order was passed against the petitioner. The petitioner 's appeal against the dismissal order was dismissed by the appellate authority. Revision Petition preferred by him also met the same fate. In the present Writ Petition, challenging the dismissal order, the 895 petitioner contended that during the relevant time, there was absolute shortage of personnel, non supply of torch or candle or kerosene and absence of proper arrangements to keep custody of the undertrial prisoners. It was also contended that all the defence witness cited by him were not examined and that the enquiry was mala fide since the earlier enquiry was dropped and he was exonerated. The Respondents contended that no prejudice was caused to the petitioner since full opportunity was afforded to him, that the venue of the enquiry was shifted only to avoid unnecessary delay and the petitioner never objected to it during the enquiry.

Dismissing the Writ Petition, this Court, HELD: 1. It is necessary to examine the scope of Article 32 of the Constitution in this case. Since the two undertrials were entrusted to the custody of the petitioner and they escaped, the responsibility was entirely on the petitioner. No doubt, he pleaded that the arrangements were inadequate and the two undertrial prisoners took advantage, dug a tunnel through which they managed to escape. The Deputy Superintendent of Police who visited the premises inspected the same and made a report in which he clearly observed that there was certainly some negligence in not noticing the activities of the undertrial prisoners and therefore an enquiry was necessary.

By a Notification dated 31.1.1968, the Corporation purported to enhance the slaughtering fee in both the categories eightfold, with effect from February 1 1968. Some butchers of the city questioned the revision of rates on the ground that the proposed enhanced fee was wholly disproportionate to the cost of the services and supervision and was in fact not a fee, but a tax. During the pendency of the writ petitions in the High Court, by virtue of an interim arrangement, the appellant, was permitted to collect slaughtering fees at double the rates fixed in 1953 and as a result thereof the Corporation realised a sum of Rs. 4,24,494/ . The budget of the Corporation under item XIV B showed a sum of Rs. 2,56,000 as the expenditure involved in connection with the slaughter houses. Comparing the amount of actual realisation of fee at the rates permitted by the court with the amount of expenditure as revealed by the budget and excluding from consideration all expenditure not shown in the budget from item XIV B, the High Court came to the conclusion that even if the original fee was doubled the amount realised would be more than sufficient to meet the expenditure involved and, therefore, there was no reason at all for increasing the fee eightfold and so the proposed fee was no fee but a tax for which there is no legislative mandate. Hence the appeal by special leave. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1;1 The increase of the slaughtering fee from 0.25 P to Rs. 2.00 per animal in the case of small animals and from rupee 1.00 to Rs. 8.00 in the case of large animals was wholly justified, in the Circumstances of the case.

The Items of expenditure covered by item XIV B of the Municipal Budget are evidently those items of expenditure which are incurred directly and exclusively in connection with slaughter houses. There are several other items of expenditure the whole or part of which is attributable to slaughter houses like the expenditure involved in the purchase, maintenance and the use of trucks and other vehicles for the removal of filth from slaughter houses, conservancy, petrol oil etc. , the expenditure incurred in connection with the maintenance of supervisory staff like a fulltime Veterinary officer, Municipal Health officer, Deputy Health officer and Zonal Head officers, the cost of depreciation of the buildings and fittings in slaughter houses, expansion and improvement of slaughter houses for utilities etc. but actually debited to other heads of account under the Municipal budget. Apparently, the High Court was under an erroneous impression that the fees collected should be shown to be related to expenditure incurred directly and exclusively in connection with the slaughtering of animals in its slaughter houses and also, shown as such in the Municipal budget. [1007 B H, 1008 A B] 2. Vicissitudes of time and necessitudes of history contribute to changes of philosophical attitudes, concepts, ideas and ideals and, with them, the meanings of words and phrases and the language itself. The philosophy and the language of the law are no exceptions. Words and phrases take colour and character from the context and the times and speak differently in different contexts and times. Words and phrases have not only a meaning but also a content, a living content, which breathes, and so, expands and contracts. This is particularly so where the words and phrases properly belong to other disciplines. \"Tax\" and \"Pee\" are such words. They properly belong to the world of public finance but since the Constitution and the laws are also concerned with Public Finance, these words have often been adjudicated upon in an effort to discern their content. [1002 D G] 3. From the decided cases beginning from Commissioner of Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras vs Shri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiyar ; till date, it is clear that: (i) There is no generic difference between a tax and fee, though broadly a tax is a compulsory exaction as part of a common burden, without promise of any special advantages to classes of tax payers whereas a fee is a payment for services rendered; benefit provided or privilege conferred; (ii) Compulsion is not the hall mark of the distinction between a tax and fee; (iii) That the money collected does not go into a separate fund but goes into the Consolidated Fund does not also necessarily make a levy tax; (iv) Though a fee must have relation to the services rendered, or the advantage conferred, such relation need not be direct; a mere casual relation may be enough; (v) Further neither the incidence of the fee nor the service rendered need be uniform, (vi) That others besides those paying the fees are also benefited does not detract from the character of the fee; (vii) In fact the special benefit or advantage to the payers of the fees may even be secondary as compared with the primary motive of regulation in the public interest; (viii) Nor is the court to assume the role of a Cost Accountant. It is neither necessary nor expedient to weigh too meticulously the cost, of the services rendered 1001 etc. against the amount of fees collected so as to evenly balance the two and (ix) A correlationship is all that is necessary. Quid pro quo in the strict sense is not the only true index of a fee; nor is it necessarily absent in a tax.

            "Prediction: The Delhi Municipal Corporation purported to enhance the fee for slaughtering animals in its slaughter houses from Re. 00.25p to Rs. 2.00 for each animal, in the case of sheep, goats and pigs. The original rates were fixed in March 1953 and the revised rates were to take effect from February 1, 1968. Some butchers of the city questioned the revision of rates on the ground that the proposed enhanced fee was wholly disproportionate to the cost of the services and supervision and was in fact not a fee but a tax for which there was no legislative mandate. The High Court accepted the contention of the butchers on what appears to us a superficial view of the facts and principles. The Municipal Corporation realised a sum of Rs. 4,24,494 by way of fee. Now, the budget of the Municipal Corporation under item XIV B showed a sum that was not only a meaning but also a content, a living content which breathes, and so, expands and contracts.\n",

In proceedings for assessment for central sales tax for the year 1957 58 the assessees claimed that they were liable to pay tax at the concessional rate of tax on the turnover under sec. 8(1) of the Act where sales were made by them to registered purchasing dealers who furnished declaration in Form 'C\". The common question considered in these appeals was: When a purchasing dealer in one State furnishes in Form 'C ' prescribed under the Central Sales Tax (Registration & Turnover) Rules, 1957, to the selling dealer in another State a declaration, certifying that the goods ordered, purchased or supplied are covered by the certificate of registration obtained by the purchasing dealer in Form 'B ' prescribed under r. 5(1) of the Central Sales Tax (Regis tration & Turnover) Rule. ,, 1957, and that the goods are intended for resale, or for use in manufacture of goods for sale, or for use in the execution of contracts, or for packing of goods for resale, and that declaration is produced by the selling dealer, is it open to the Sales Tax authority under the to deny to the selling dealer the benefit of concessional rates under section 8(1) of the , on the view that the certificate in Form 'C ' mentions more purposes than one for which the goods are intended to be used, or that the goods are incapable of being used for the purpose for which they are declared to be purchased, or that the goods are applied for some other purpose not mentioned in the certificate in Form 'C '? HELD: The Act and the Rules do not impose an obligation upon the purchasing dealer to declare that goods purchased by him are intended to be used for one purpose only, even though under his certificate of registration in Form 'B ' he is entitled to purchase goods of the classes mentioned in section 8(3) (b) for more purposes than one. When the purchasing dealer furnishes a certificate in Form C without striking out any of the four alternatives, it is a representation that the goods purchased are intended to be usedfor all or any of the purposes, and the certificate complies with the requirements of the Act and the Rules. The Sales Tax Officer may scrutinise the certificate to find out whether it is genuine and may also examine the registration certificate of the purchasing dealer. to see if the goods are covered by it. But it is not for him to hold an enquiry whether the goods specified in the certificate of registration of the purchaser can be used by the purchasing dealer for any of the purpose mentioned in Form 'C '. or whether they should have been specified in the registration certificate or even that the goods purchased have in fact not been used for the purpose declared in the certificate. [2O6 B D] 199 It is contemplated in sec. 7 and the Rules that the certificate of registration may only be issued after an objective satisfaction by the notified authority that the specified goods are likely to be needed for the purpose of business of the registered dealer, and that satisfaction is open to challenge in an appropriate proceeding before the High Court and even before this Court. Correctness or propriety of satisfaction of the notified authority in issuing the certificate in Form 'E ' that the goods are likely to be required for the purpose of the business would not however be again open to challenge before another taxing authority in proceedings for assessment of tax.

            "Target: Appellant Company filed criminal complaints under Section 630(l)(b), Companies Act and Section 406, IPC against its employees (the first respondent of each appeal) as they did not vacate the company quarters after about six months even after retirement. The Judicial Magistrate, First Class dismissed the complaints as the same were not filed within the period of limitation of six months from the date of retirement of the Respondents employees. The High Court,holding that the offence under Section 630(1) was not a continuing offence, dismissed the Company 's revision petitions. In the appeal to this Court on the question, whether the offence under Section 630(l)(b) of the Companies Act is a continuing offence for the purpose of limitation, allowing the Appeals of the Appellant Company, this Court, HELD: 1. The beneficent provision contained in section 630, no doubt penal, has been purposely enacted by the legislature with the object of providing a summary procedure for retrieving the property of the company: (a) where an officer or employee of a company wrongfully obtains 397 possession of property of the company, or (b) where having been placed in possession of any such property during the course of his employment, wrongfully withholds possession of it after the termination of his employment. It is the duty of the court to place a broad and liberal construction on the provision in furtherence of the object and purpose of the legislation which would suppress the mischief and advance the remedy. [406B E] 2.\"Officer\" or \"employee\" in s.630 of the Companies Act includes both present and past officers and employees.[405B C] 3. The concept of continuing offence does not wipe out the original guilt, but it keeps the contravention alive day by day. The courts when confronted with provisions which lay down a rule of limitation governing prosecutions should give due weight and consideration to the provisions of s.473 of the Code which is in the nature of an overriding provision and according to which, notwithstanding anything contained in the provisions of Chapter XXXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure any court may take cognizance of an offence after the expiration of a period of limitation, if, inter alia, it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in the interest of justice. [409D G] 4. The expression `continuing offence ' has not been defined in the Code. The question whether a particular offence is a 'continuing offence ' or not must,therefore,necessarily depend upon the language of the statute which creates that offence, the nature of the offence and the purpose intended to be achieved by constituting the particular act as an offence. [409F H] 5.The offence under section 630 is not such as can be said to have consummated once for all. Wrongful withholding, or wrongfully obtaining possession and wrongful application of the company 's property, that is, for purposes other than those expressed or directed in the articles of the company and authorised by the Companies Act, can not be said to be terminated by a single act or fact but would subsist for the Period until the property in the offender 's possession is delivered up or refunded. It is an offence committed over a span of time and the last act of the offence will control the commencement of the period of limitation and need be alleged. The offence consists of a course of conduct arising from a singleness of thought, purpose of refusal to deliver up or refund which May be deemed a single impulse. Considered from another angle, it consists of a continuous series of acts which endures after the period of consummation on refusal to deliver up or refund the property. It is 398 not an instantaneous offence and limitation begins with the cessation of the criminal act, i.e., with the delivering up or refund of the property. It will be a recurring or continuing offence until the wrongful possession, wrongful withholding or wrongful application is vacated or put an end to. The offence continues until the property wrongfully obtained or wrongfully withheld or knowingly misapplied is delivered up or refunded to the company. For failure to do so sub section (2) prescribes the punishment. [409H 410E] 6. The offence under section 630 of the Companies Act is not one time but a continuing offence and the period of limitation must be computed accordingly, and when so done, the complaints could not be said to have been barred by limitation.

            "Target: The appellant company challenged the imposition of water tax by the Rampur Municipal Board in a petition under article 226 of the Constitution of India on the ground that the tax had not been imposed according to law inasmuch as the proposals and draft rules had been published by the Board in an Urdu paper whereas according to the mandatory provisions of section 131(3) read with section 93(3) of the U.P. Municipalities Act, 1916, they should have been published,in a Hindi paper. The High Court dismissed the petition but granted a certificate under article 133(1)(c). The questions for consideration were whether the whole of section 131(3) was mandatory, or the part of it requiring publication in the manner laid down in section 94(3) i.e., in a Hindi newspaper was merely directory; and whether the publication in the Government Gazette of the notification imposing the tax was not conclusive proof, as provided in section 135(3), of the prescribed procedure having been observed. HELD: (Per GAJENDRAGADKAR\" C. J., WANcHoo and RAGHUBAR DAYAL JJ.) (i) Section 131(3) can be divided into two parts the first one providing that the proposal and draft rules for a tax intended to be imposed should be published for the objections of the public, if any, and the second laying down that the publication must be in the manner laid down in section 94(3). Considering the object of the provisions for publication namely to enable the public to place its viewpoint before the Board it Is necessary to hold that the first part of the section is mandatory, for to hold otherwise would be to render the whole procedure prescribed for the imposition of taxes nugatory. The second part of the section is, however, merely directory. What it substantially requires is that the publication should be in Hindi in a local paper, and if that is done that would be compliance with section 94(3). In the instant case publication was made in Hindi in a local paper which on the evidence seems to have good circulation in Rampur. There is no regularly published local Hindi newspaper. There was, in the circumstances, substantial compliance with the provisions of section 94(3) in this case. [977 E F; 978 D F; 980 C; 981 A B] (ii) Section 135(3) provides that a notification of the imposition of tax in the Government Gazette was conclusive proof that the tax had been imposed in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Whether such a notification will save a tax which has been imposed without at all complying with one of the mandatory provisions of the relevant law was a question that did not directly arise in the case. In the instant case there had been compliance with the mandatory part of section 131(3) and substantial compliance with the second part. Therefore a. 135(3) applied to the case 971 and the objection that the tax was not validly imposed could not succeed. [983 B D; 983 D E]. K. Kamaraja Nadar vs Kunju Thevar, , relied on.

Per HIDAYATULLAH J. A Municipal Committee enjoys powers of taxation not as a legislature but as a delegate of the legislature. Taxes levied by it are in effect levied by the Government. What the Municipality does in exercise of the delegated power can be effective only if the conditions laid down with the grant of the power are complied with and the Government finally approves the tax. Once the Government after giving its approval has notified its imposition in the Government Gazette the tax is deemed to be conclusively imposed in accordance with the procedure laid down. [985 H to 986 D] Some conditions which are laid down are for the protection of taxpayers and some others are for ministerial operations. The first kind are fundamental and cannot be overlooked. Conditions which promote dispatch or provide for ministerial operation are directory and substantial compliance is sufficient. [986 G] The direction to publish the notice in a paper published in Hindi regarded as sufficient compliance in the case. [987 C D] The Berar Swadeshi Vanaspati vs Municipal Committee, Shegaon, , relied on. Per MUDHOLKAR J. Where a verb used in a provision governs two different matters it cannot be given one meaning insofar as it relates to one matter and another meaning insofar as it relates to another matter.[988 F] Since section 94(3) is clearly directory it is immaterial to consider whether section 131(3) is directory or mandatory or to read it as partly one and partly the other and depart from the normal rule of construction which discountenances reading a word in a provision in two different senses. [988 G H] The essential requirement of section 94(3) is publication in a local newspaper. Where the requirement is satisfied, the omission to obtain a direction from the State Government permitting publication in a newspaper other then one in Hindi language is not of much consequence. Upon this view the question whether section 131(3) is mandatory or whether section 135(3) has become void by reason of article 13(1) of the Constitution or whether it ran cure a defect resulting from non compliance with a mandatory provision does not at all arise for consideration.

            "Target: Under section 433(f) of the , a company may be wound up by the Court, if the Court is of opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up. Section 44(g) of the Partnership Act also speaks of the \"just and equitable clause\". One RPJ agreed with VDJ and MPJ who are carrying on the business under the name and style of \"Chimanram Motilal\" to start a new business of iron and steel in co partnership and for that purpose, an account was opened in the name of \"Raghunath Prasad Jhunjhunwalla Ka Sir Khata\" in the books of \"Chimanram Motilal\". It was agreed that RPJ should have 3/8th share and VDJ with MPJ should have 5/8th share of the proposed business. Before the said proposed business could be started, at the suggestion of VDJ, actually a limited company was formed in August,. 1956 under the with the understanding that (i) VDJ with MPJ should finance the entire business. (ii) the share in the company should be held by RPJ, VDJ and MPJ and the members of their respective families in the proportion of 3/8th and 5/8th as agreed to before and (iii) that RPJ and his group would generally look after the day to day business of the company under the general control and supervision of VDJ. The nominal capital of the company was Rs. 5 lacs divided into 2500 equity shares of Rs. 100/ each. RPJ and another ACD, an employee and nominee of VDJ, became the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association of the company and also became its first directors. On 23 8 1956, VDJ and MPJ were appointed as directors of the company. On 23 11 1957, ACD resigned and PCJ (son of RPJ) was opted in his place. RPJ was appointed a director in charge of the company and both RPJ and PCJ were paid monthly remunerations. Following a family partition between VDJ and MPJ in the year 1958, the shares of MPJ were transferred in the name of the wife of VDJ and MPJ resigned from the Board of Directors on 21 1 1959. Since that date till October, 1965 the Board of Directors were RPJ. PCJ and VDJ, when VDJ got his son VKJ appointed as Technical Director of the company. Though the business of the company was managed by RPJ and PCJ, the business policy, the appointment of staff, general supervision of the work of the business etc., were in the hands of VDJ. From 1959 onwards the factory commenced its regular production and substantial profits were made between 1960 and 1965 except in the year 1961 when there was some loss. Finding that there has been a mismanagement of affairs of RPJ and PCJ to the tune of Rs. 8 lacs the VDJ group who were holding the major shares numbering, 3125, in order to safeguard their interest and the business, called the Board 's meeting on 27 5 1966 and the Board countermanded all the previous resolutions and thus took away all the powers of RPJ. The extraordinary general meeting called on 28 5 1966 resolved to remove RPJ and PCJ as directors of the company and to appoint persons belonging to VDJ 's group as directors. This led to the filing of an application for winding up under section 433(f) of the by RPJ before the company Judge of the Calcutta High Court contending that the company was in the nature of a 227 partnership and is liable to be wound up in view of the loss of confidence between the two groups/members and on the alleged ouster of RPJ group. The Petition for winding up was dismissed by the company Judge inasmuch as (i) the substratum of the company was not gone; (ii) the deadlock could be resolved by the articles; (iii) there were alternative remedies open: and (iv) lack of probity did not result in prejudice to the company 's business affecting petitioner 's rights as share holder, but only affected his right as director. The appellate Bench, however, allowed the appeal of the respondent RPJ and ordered the winding up of the company in the facts and circumstances of the case, viz., impossibility of carrying on business by RPJ as a partner, the exclusion of RPJ from the partnership concern and loss of mutual confidence between RPJ and VDJ group. Dismissing the appeal by certificate, the Court, ^ HELD: (1) In an application under section 433, the company Court will have to keep in mind the position of the company as a whole and the interests of the shareholders and see that they do not suffer in a fight for power that ensues between the two groups. The court should see that a prima facie case has been made out before it is admitted on the allegations in the petition. Even admission of a petition which will lead to advertisement of the winding up proceedings us likely to cause immense injury to the company if ultimately the application has to be dismissed. The interest of the applicant alone is not of predominant consideration. It is not proper principle to encourage hasty petitions under section 433 without first attempting to sort out the dispute and controversy between the members in the domestic forum in conformity with the articles of association. There must be materials to show when \"just and equitable clause\" is involved, that it is just and equitable not only to the persons applying for winding up but also to the company and to all its shareholders. [243 C D, 240 H, 241 A] (2) Section 433 of the is modelled on the English . The Indian law is developing on its own lines and making progress of its own circle. The courts will have to adjust and adapt limit or extend the principles derived from English decisions entitled as they are to great respect, suiting the conditions of our society and the country in general, always, however, with one primary consideration in view that the general interests of the shareholders may not be readily sacrificed at the altar of squabbles of directors of powerful groups for powerful to manage the company. [240A, C D] Ramanandi Kuer vs Kalawati Kuer, , applied. (3) Section 433 of the , provides six recipes so that the company may be wound up by the court. Under section 433(f) which is identical in terms with section 222(f) of the English Act of 1948, a company may be wound up by the court if the court is of opinion that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up. It is now well established that the sixth clause, viz., \"just and equitable\" is not to be read as being \"ejusdem generis\" with the preceding five clauses. The just and equitable clause leaves the entire matter to the wide and wise judicial discretion of the court. The only limitations are force and the content of the words themselves \"just and equitable\". Section 44(g) of the Indian Partnership Act also contains the words \"just and equitable\". [241 B E] Section 433(f) is to be read with section 443(2) of the Act, which provides that where the petition is presented on the ground that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up, the court may refuse to make an order of winding up if it is of opinion that some other remedy is available to the petitioners and that they are acting unreasonably in seeking to have the company wound up instead of pursuing that other remedy. Again under section 307 and 398 of the Act there are preventive provisions in the Act as a safeguard against oppression in management. These provisions also indicate that relief under section 433(f) based on the \"just and equitable\" clause is in the nature of a last resort when other remedies are not efficacious enough to protect the general interests of the company. [241 E G] 228 Madan Lal and another vs Groin Chambers Ltd., Muzaffar Nagar and others; , and section P. Jain vs Kalinga Tubes Ltd. ; , followed. (4) In applying the principles of dissolution of partnership to companies, the following factors must be present: Equal shareholding; complete deadlock in the administration of the company; lack of probity and mismanagement in the conduct of affairs of the company [In re Yenidje Tobacco Co. Ltd. The just and equitable clause cannot be invoked if a deadlock can be resolved by the articles and if there are alternate remedies. (In re Cuthbert Cooper and Sons Ltd., 1937 Ch. If there is no justifiable lack of confidence grounded on the conduct of the directors in the conduct of management of the companies affairs (Rajahmundry Electric Supply Corporation These are sound principles depending upon the nature, composition and character of the company. The principles are good as they are their application in a given case or in all cases, generally creates problems and difficulties. [233D E; 236 D] (5) The principle of \"just and equitable\" clause baffles a precise definition. It must rest with the judicial discretion of the court depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. When more than one family or several friends and relations together form a company and there is no right as such agreed upon for active participation of members who are sought to be excluded from management the principles of dissolution of partnership cannot be liberally invoked. Besides, it is only when shareholding is more or less equal and there is a case of complete deadlock in the company on account of lack of probity in the management of the company and there is no hope or possibility of smooth and efficient continuance of the company as a commercial concern, there may arise a case for winding up on the \"just and equitable\" ground. In a given case the principles of dissolution of partnership may apply squarely if the apparent structure of the company is not the real structure and on piercing the veil it is found that in reality it is a partnership. These are necessarily equitable considerations and may in a given case be superimposed on law. Whether it would be so done in a particular case cannot be put in the strict jacket of an inflexible formula. [247G, D F] In re Cathbert Cooper & Sons Limited, [1937] Ch. 392; and In re Yenidje Tobacco Company Limited, , discussed. In re Ebrahimi and Westbourane Galleries Ltd. , discussed and considered.

Jain vs Kalinga Tubes Ltd., , followed. (6) In the present case, assuming partnership had been contemplated the idea was deliberately abandoned; the company was started with one ACD who had no relation with MCJ group or the VDJ group but an employee of VDJ, which would negative the idea of partnership which connotes equal status among the partners; While it is true that a director may work in the company on remuneration. RPJ however served like an employee on monthly salary not on his own initiative enjoying an equal partner 's freedom and prestige but directly under the supervision and control of VDJ acknowledging a status definitely of a subordinate character; The voluntary financial involvement of a large stake by VDJ carefully thought to be protected against erosion of his interests by constant vigil on the day to day working does not fit in with the 229 concept of a partnership; Even the account was being opened for the purpose of the formation of the company and the account was closed on such formation. The shareholding is between the two family groups, it cannot be said that the company thereby takes the image of partnership. On the other hand, the fact that after discussion, the parties deliberately abandoned the idea of farming a partnership would go to show that there was no intention to carry on business as partners. [242E H] There are no special features which would unquestionably lead to the conclusion that the company is in substance a partnership and the principle of \"just and equitable clause\" cannot be therefore, extended.

            "Target: In criminal writ petition No. 292 of 1986, preferred by detenu 's wife on various grounds, the Vacation Judge ordered his release on parole till further orders. However, when the petition came up for hearing before the Division Bench on 3rd March, 1987 the counsel confined his submissions to one aspect only that arose out of the proceedings in Court i.e., that the period of parole should not be added to the period of detention. That plea was rejected and the petition dis missed on 22nd April, 1987. In the present writ petition filed thereafter on April 27, 1987 it was averred that the counsel did not give up the other points in the earlier writ petition, and had the Court indicated that the petitioner 's submission would not find favour with it he would have proceeded to argue the case. Further, two more points were raised: (1) that the detenu had been prejudiced in making an effective representation to the Board against his detention in the absence of the sum mons issued under section 108 of the Customs Act to him, which document had not been supplied in spite of demand, and (2) that since the detenu was already in custody at the time the order of detention was served the said order was liable to be quashed. Dismissing the writ petition, HELD: 1. It is common experience that when several contentions are advanced in the pleadings, counsel chooses to press one or some out of the several contentions at the time of the hearing. In the instant case, only one point was argued at the previous hearing. It was open to the counsel to make full submissions on all aspects arising in the writ petition. That having not been done it was improper on his part to raise such allegations. [844A, D] 841 2.1 The detenu had been called by the Customs Authori ties for investigation on February 27, 1986. A statement had been made by him under section 108 of the Customs Act and there after he was taken into custody and produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, who remanded him to custody and directed him to be produced on the following day in the court. By the time the order of detention under section 3(1) of the COFEPOSA Act for one year came to be made on February 28, 1986 he was in jail at the most for one day. Chargesheet had not been submitted against him in the crimi nal case. [847FG] 2.2 Since there was no summons and the detenu had been orally directed to attend the office by the authorities concerned, it could not be held that summons under section 108 of the Customs Act was in existence. Once the summons was out in existence it could not be said that there was prejudice to the detenu on account of the authority 's withholding the summons. [846D] 3.1 The fact that the detenu was already in detention did not take away the jurisdiction of the detaining authori ty in making an order of preventive detention. What is necessary in a case of that type is to satisfy the court when detention is challenged on that ground that the detain ing authority was aware of the fact that the detenu was already in custody and yet he was subjectively satisfied that his order of detention became necessary. [851D] 3.2 In the instant case, there was sufficient material to show that the detaining authority was aware of the fact that the petitioner was in custody when the order was made yet he was satisfied that his preventive detention was necessary. The order of detention was, therefore, not viti ated.

            "Target: Section 25F(b) of the , provided: \"No workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall be retrenched by that employer until . (b) the workman has been paid, at the time of retrenchment, compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days ' average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months . \" The dispute between the appellant company and its workmen related to the claim for gratuity made by the latter and it was the appellant 's contention that in the scheme of gratuity framed by the Tribunal no gratuity should be paid to workmen who would be entitled to receive retrenchment compensation under section 25F of the . Before section 25F was introduced in the Act by Act 43 of 1953, workmen were given the benefit of both retrenchment compensation and gratuity by industrial awards, but the decisions were not always uniform. Ordinance V was promulgated on October 24, 1953, by section 25E(b) of which it was provided that before a workman was retrenched he must be paid at the time of retrenchment gratuity which shall be equivalent to 15 days ' average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months. The 33 Ordinance was followed by Act 43 of 1953, which was deemed to have come into force on October 24, 1953; and in the statement of aims and objects of the Act it was said \" that a workman . shall not be retrenched until he has been given one month 's notice in writing or one month 's wages in lieu of such notice, and also a gratuity . \". Section 25(F)(b) of the Act was in the same terms as section 25E(b) of the Ordinance,, except that for the word CC gratuity \" the expression \" retrenchment compensation \" was substituted. The appellant 's case was that after section 25F was enacted there was no longer any scope for framing gratuity schemes in addition to the statutory retrenchment compensation for retrenched employees on the grounds (1) that both in section 25E(b) of the Ordinance and the statement of aims and objects of the amending Act, the word \"gratuity\" had been used and not retrenchment compensation, (2) that in determining the amount of compensation payable to a retrenched workman the length of his past service had been taken into account, and schemes of gratuity also provide for payment of gratuity on similar considerations and adopt a similar measure, and (3) that a retrenched workman would get both retrenchment compensation and gratuity and so get more than what other workmen with corresponding length of service would get on their retirement. Held: (1) that for construing S, 25F of the , the words used in the statement about the aims and objects of the Act are not relevant and that the character of the payment prescribed by the section could only be determined by the expression \" retrenchment compensation used therein ; and, (2) that in the absence of any provision in the excluding the claim or grant of gratuity the mere enactment of section 25F cannot oust the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals to entertain claims for gratuity schemes or make it improper or unjust to frame such schemes for all employees including those who are retrenched. The object of granting retrenchment compensation is to enable the workman who is given partial protection to tide over the period of unemployment, and to keep his gratuity safe and unused so that it may be available to him after his retirement. The two claims complement each other, and the fact that they appear to constitute a double benefit cannot affect their validity. \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant had raised an industrial dispute in 1950 which covered their claims for scale of pay, dearness allowance, provident fund and gratuity and it was referred to the tribunal in these words: \" Gratuity employees should be paid gratuity on the scale and the conditions prescribed in the industrial tribunal's award in Ref. (IT) No. 82 of 1950 dated August 13, 1951. It should also be paid to those whose services have been terminated by the management after the termination of the aforesaid award. \" The respondents urged that the State Government had no jurisdiction to confine their demand to the scheme of gratuity as framed by Mr. Thakore, and they urged the tribunal to consider their claim for a revision of the said award. The appellate tribunal agreed with the view taken by the tribunal and rejected the appellant's contention. It also observed that even if it was open to the respondents to agitate for the revision of that award there was not much chance\n",

            "Target: While pronouncing its Judgment in Reserve Bank of India vs Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd., ; , this Court observed that it would be open to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to take such steps as were open to it in law to regulate 407 the savings schemes run by Residuary Non Banking Companies (RNBCs) to prevent exploitation of ignorant investors while at the same time taking care to protect the thousands of employees working in such companies. This Court also expressed grave concern at the mushroom growth of financial investment companies offering staggering rates of interests to depositors leading to suspicion whether these companies were speculative ventures floated to attract unwary and credulous investors and capture their hard earned savings. Pursuant to the said observations of this Court and keeping in mind the public interest, the RBI in exercise of its powers under sections 45J and 45K of the , and of all powers enabling it in that behalf, issued certain directions by way of Notification No. DFC 55/DG (O) 87 dated 15.5.1987. A Writ Petition was filed before the High Court challenging the constitutional validity of the said directions issued by the RBI. A Single Judge of the High Court passed certain interim orders. Being aggrieved against the interim orders, the RBI preferred an appeal before the Division Bench. The Division Bench disposed of the appeal as well as the Writ Petition. It held that the RBI was empowered to issue directions to the Residuary Non Banking Companies in the interest of depositors; but to the extent such directions were found to be prohibitory or unworkable and as such unreasonable, would be beyond the powers of RBI. Peerless which became a party respondent, filed an application for clarification of the judgment, as regards payment against discontinued certificates. The High Court clarified that in such cases the depositors be allowed to take loan against payments made till discontinuance on such terms and conditions as the company may stipulate. The present appeals were filed by RBI against the orders of the High Court. A Writ Petition has been filed directly before this Court, challenging the directions as being ultra vires of sections 45J and 45K of the as also violative of the provisions of the constitution. On behalf of the Writ Petitioners it was contended that since the 1987 directions issued by RBI were in the nature of subordinate legislation, it was clear that RBI overstepped the bounds of the 408 parent statute; that the source of power for issuing the directions as being derived from section 45L was only an after thought; that from the working results it appeared impossible to carry on the traditional business for any longer period without incurring huge losses; that from in the business carried on by Peerless and other similar RNBCs that the working capital is generated out of the subscriptions received from the certificate holders either in lump sum or in instalments and such deposits are paid back with the guaranteed accretions, bonus, interest etc. in terms of contract at the end of the stipulated term; that the interest of the depositors has not been impaired in any manner whatsoever by the method of accountancy followed by Peerless and all similar companies, namely, appropriation of a part of the subscription to the profit and loss account and meeting the working capital requirements out of the same. On behalf of the appellant RBI, it was contended that it had the power to issue the said directions, that the said directions were issued in pursuance to this Court 's observations, and in public interest; that the said directions had not imposed any restriction on the right to carry on business but only placed a restriction with respect to one of the modes of raising reserves i.e. through public deposits; that the directions cannot be condemned as being violative of Article 19(1) (g); and that formula laid down by the High Court was self defeating and deprived altogether the benefits of security provisions given to depositors under the 1987 directions. On behalf of the Peerless Field Officers Association, it was contended that if the directions of 1987 were to be upheld, the undertakings of Peerless would face inevitable closure and almost 14 lac field officers would lose their only source of livelihood. Allowing the appeals filed by RBI and dismissing the Writ Petition filed by the Finance Companies, this Court, HELD: Per Kasliwal, J 1.1 The Reserve Bank was competent and authorised to issue the impugned directions of 1987, in exercise of powers conferred under Section 45K(3) of the Act. [431 C] 1.2 A combined reading of Section 45J, 45K and 45L of the unmistakably goes to show that the Reserve Bank if it considers necessary in the public interest so to do, can specify the conditions subject to which any prospectus or advertisement soliciting deposits of money from the public may be 409 issued. It can also give directions to non banking institutions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits, including the rates of interest payable on such deposits, and the periods for which deposits may be received. This latter power flows from sub section (3) of Section 45K of the Act. The Bank under this provision can give directions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits. Thus a very wide power is given to the RBI to issue dirctions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits. It cannot be considered as a power restricted or limited to receipt of deposits only. Such an interpretation would be violating the language of section 45K (3) which furnishes a wide power to the Reserve Bank to give any directions in respect of any matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits. The Reserve Bank under this provision is entitled to give directions with regard to the manner in which the deposits are to be invested and also the manner in which such deposits are to be disclosed in the balance sheet or books of accounts of the company. The word `any ' qualifying matters relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits in the above provision is of great significance and directions of 1987 are fully covered under Section 45K (3) of the Act, which gives power to the Reserve Bank to issue such directions. [430 D H; 431 A] 1.3 When an authority takes action which is within its competence, it cannot be said to be invalid merely because it purports to be made under a wrong provision, if it can be shown to be within its power under any other provision. [431 B] Indian Aluminium Company etc. vs Kerala State Electricity Board; , , relied on. 2.1 The function of the Court is to see that lawful authority is not abused but not to attain itself the task entrusted to that authority. It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers must take care not to exceed or abuse its power. It must keep within the limits of the authority committed to it. It must act in good faith and it must act reasonably. Courts are not to interfere with economic policy which is the function of experts. It is not the function of the Courts to sit in Judgment over matters of economic policy and it must necessarily be left to the expert bodies. The function of the Court is not to advice in matters relating to financial and economic policies for which bodies like Reserve Bank are fully competent. It would be hazardous and risky for the Courts to tread an 410 unknown path and should leave such task to the expert bodies. [442 C D] 2.2 Reserve Bank of India which is banker 's bank is a creature of Statue. It has large contingent of expert advice relating to matters affecting the economy of the entire country and nobody can doubt the bonafides of the Reserve Bank in issuing the impugned directions of 1987. The Reserve Bank plays an important role in the economy and financial affairs of India and one of its important functions is to regulate the banking system in the country. It is the duty of the Reserve Bank to safeguard the economy and financial stability of the country. In fact the directions of 1987 were issued by RBI after mature consideration with the help and advice of experts. [441 B D, 443 D E] Delhi Cloth and General Mills etc. vs Union of India etc. ; , ; M/s Prag Ice & Oil Mills and Anr. vs Union of India; , ; Shri Sitaram Sugar Company Limited and Anr. vs Union of India & Ors. , ; ; R.K. Garg vs Union of India & Ors. etc.; , , relied on. The Reserve Bank was right in taking the stand that if the companies want to do their business, they should invest their own working capital and find such resources elsewhere with which the Reserve Bank has no concern. [445 C] 4. It is not the concern of this Court to find out as to whether actuaial method of accounting or any other method would be feasible or possible for the companies to adopt while carrying out the conditions contained in paragraphs 6 and 12 of the directions of 1987. The companies are free to adopt any mode of accounting permissible under the law but it is certain that they will have to follow the entire terms and conditions contained in the directions of 1987 including those contained in paragraphs 6 and 12. [445 E F] 5.1 It is not possible for the Court to determine as to how much percentage of deposit of first instalment should be allowed towards expenses which may consist of commission to agents, office expenses etc. It would depend from company to company based on various factors such as paid up capital, percentage of commission paid to the agents, rate of interest paid to the depositors, period of maturity for repayment, office expenses and various other factors necessary to mop up working capital out of the depositors money. 411 One cannot ignore the possibility of persons having no stake of their own starting such business and after collecting huge deposits from the investors belonging to the poor and weaker sections of the society residing in rural areas, and to stop such business after a few years thus devouring the hard earned money of the small investors. In such kind of business, the agents always take interest in finding new depositors because they get a high rate of commission out of the first instalment, but they do not have same enthusiasm in respect of deposit of subsequent instalments. In these circumstances if the Reserve Bank has issued the directions of 1987 to safeguard the larger interest of the public and small depositors it cannot be said that the directions are so unreasonable as to be declared constitutionally invalid. [447 E H, 448 A] 5.2 It cannot be said that the directions of 1987 amount to prohibition of the business in a commercial sense and without reasonable basis. Nor are the directions violative of Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution of India. [442 G H, 443 A B] Mohammad Yasin vs The Town Area Committee, Jalalabad and Anr., ; ; Premier Automobiles Ltd. and Anr vs Union of India, ; ; Shree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. vs Union of India, ; , referred to. So far as Peerless is concerned there is no possibility of its closing down such business. It has already large accumulated funds collected by making profits in the past serveral years. Thus it has enough working capital in order to meet the expenses. It cannot be said that after some years Peerless will have to close down its business if the directions contained in paragraphs 6 and 12 are to be followed. The working capital is not needed every year as it can be rotated after having invested once. If the entire amount of the subscriptions is deposited or invested in the proportion of 10% in public sector banks, 70% in approved securities and 20% in other investments, such amounts will also start earning interest which can be added and adjusted while depositing or investing the subsequent years ' deposits of the subscribers. In any case it lies with the new entrepreneurs while entering such field of business to make arrangement of their own resources for working capital and for meeting the expenses and they cannot insist in utilising the money of the depositors for this purpose. So far as the companies already in this field they must have earned profits in the past years which can be utilised as their working capital. It is important to note that the direc 412 tions of 1987 have been made applicable from 15th May, 1987 prospectively and not retrospectively. [447 H; 448 C F] 7. The directions of 1987 as well as any other directions issued from time to time by the Reserve Bank relating to economic or financial policy are never so sacrosanct that the same cannot be changed. Even the financial budget for every year depends on the economic and financial policy of the Government existing at the relevant time. So far as the impugned directions are concerned if it is found in future that the same are not workable or working against the public interest, the Reserve Bank is always free to change its policy and scrap or amend the directions as and when necessary. If at any time, the Reserve Bank feels that the business of the kind run at present by the Peerless and other companies in terms of the directions of 1987 are not yielding the result as envisaged by the Reserve Bank, it will always be prepared to consider any new proposals which may be conductive both in the interest of the large multitude of the investors as well as the employees of such companies. [448 G H, 449 A B] Per Ramaswamy, J. (Concurring) : 1. The directions of 1987 issued by RBI are within the power of the RBI to provide tardy, stable, identifiable and monitorable method of operations by each RNBC and its compliance of the directions. This will ensure security to the depositors at all times and also make the accounts of the company accurate, accountable and easy to monitor the working system of the company itself and continuance of its workmen. The directions in paragraphs 6 and 12 are just, fair and reasonable not only to the depositors, but in the long run to the every existence of the company and its continued business itself. Therefore, they are legal, valid and constitutionally permissible. [464 G H, 465 A] 2. Section 45K of the empowers the RBI to collect information from non banking institutions as to deposit and to give directions that every non banking institution shall furnish to the Bank, in such form, at such intervals and within such time, such statements, information or particulars relating to or connected with deposits received by the non banking institution, as may be specified by RBI by general or special order including the rates of interest and other terms and conditions on which they are received. Under sub section (3) thereof the RBI is entitled to issue 413 in the public interest directions to non banking institutions in respect of any matter relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits including the rates of interest payable on such deposits and the periods for which deposits may be received. The use of the adjective `any ' matter relating to or connected with the receipt of deposits is wide and comprehensive to empower the RBI to issue directions in connection therewith or relating to the receipt of deposits. But exercise of the power is hedged with and should be `in the public interest '. [450 C F] 3.1 The State can regulate the exercise of the fundamental right to save the public from a substantive evil. The existence of the evil as well as the means adopted to check it are the matters for the legislative judgment. But the court is entitled to consider whether the degree and mode of the regulation is in excess of the requirement or is imposed in an arbitrary manner. The Court has to see whether the measure adopted is relevant or appropriate to the power exercised by the authority or whether it over stepped the limits of social legislation. Smaller inroads may lead to larger inroads and ultimately result in total prohibition by indirect method. If if directly transgresses or substantially and inevitably affects the fundametal right, it becomes unconstitutional, but not where the impact is only remotely possible or incidental. The Court must life the veil of the form and appearance to discover the true character and the nature of the legislation, and every endeavour should be made to have the efficacy of fundamental right maintained and the legislature is not invested with unbounded power. The Court has, therefore, always to guard against the gradual encroachments and strike down a restriction as soon as it reaches that magnitude of total annihilation of the right. [453 F H, 454 A] 3.2 In the interest of the general public, the law may impose restrictions on the freedom of the citizen to start or carry on his business. Whether an impugned provision imposing a fetter on the exercise of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 19(1) (g) amounts to a reasonable restriction imposed in the interest of general public, must be adjudged not in the background of any theoretical standard or pre determinate patterns, but in the light of the nature and the incidence of the right, the interest of the general public sought to be secured by imposing restrictions and the reasonableness of the quality and the extent of the fetters imposed by the directions. The credit worthiness of RNBCs undoubtedly would 414 be sensitive. It thrives upon the confidence of the public, on the honesty of its management and its reputation of solvency. The directions intended to promote `freedom ' and facility which are required to be regulated in the interest of all concerned. [457 E F] Hatisingh Mfg. Co. Ltd. & Anr. vs Union of India & Ors. , ; ; Latafat Ali Khan & Ors. vs State of U.P., [1971] Supp. SCR 719, relied on. There is presumption of constitutionality of every statute and its validity is not to be determined by artificial standards. The court has to examine with some strictness the substance of the legislation to find what actually and really the legislature has done. The court would not be over persuaded by the mere presence of the legislation. In adjudging the reasonableness of the law, the court will necessarily ask the question whether the measure or scheme is just, fair, reasonable and appropriate or unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrarily interferes with the exercise of the right guaranteed in of the Constitution. The Court has to maintain a delicate balance between the public interest envisaged in the challenged provision and the individual 's right taking into account the nature of his right said to be infringed, the underlying purpose of the restriction, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion of the restriction imposed, the prevailing condition at the time, the surrounding circumstances, the larger public interest which the law seeks to achieve and all other relevant factors germane for the purpose. All these factors should enter into the zone of consideration to find the reasonableness of the impugned restriction. The Court weighs in each case which of the two conflicting public or private interest demands greater protection and if it finds that the restriction imposed is appropriate, fair and reasonable, it would uphold the restriction. The court would not uphold a restriction which is not germane to achieve the purpose of the statute or is arbitrary or out of its limits. [454 B C, E G] 5. The directions are incorporated and became part of the Act itself. They must be governed by the same principles as the statute itself. The statutory presumption that the legislature inserted every part thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention should be given affect to, would be applicable to the directions of 1987 as well. [445 E] 6.1 The RBI issued the directions to regulate the operations 415 of the RNBCs, to safeguard the interest of the depositors. Payment of interest, bonus, premium or other advantage, in whatever name it may be called is reward for waiting or parting with liquidity. It is paid because of positive time preference (one rupee today is preferred to one rupee tomorrow) on the part of the depositor. Therefore, the directions avowed to preserve the right of the depositors to receive back the amount deposited with the contracted rate of interest; it aims to prevent depletion of the deposits collected from the weaker segments of the society and also tends to affect free flow of the business of the RNBCs who would desire to operate in their own way. [455 F H] 6.2 Mushroom growth of non banking agencies put afloat diverse schemes with alluring offers of staggering high rate of interest and other catchy advantages which would generate suspicion of the bona fides of the offer. But gullible depositors are lured to make deposits. It is not uncommon that after collecting fabulous deposits, some unscrupulous people surreptiously close the company and decamp with the collections keeping the depositors at bay. Therefore, the need to regulate the deposits/subscriptions, in particular in private sector became imperative to prevent exploitation or mismanagement as a social justice strategem. [457 A B] 6.3 RBI occupies place of `pre eminence ' to ensure monetary discipline and to regulate the economy or the credit system of the country as an expert body. It also advises the Government in public finance and monetary regulations. The banks or non banking institutions shall have to regulate their operations in accordance with not only as per the provisions of the Act but also the rules and directions or instuctions issued by the RBI in exercise of the power thereunder. Chapter 3B of the expressly deals with regulations of deposit and finance received by the RNBCs. The directions, therefore, are statutory regulations. [455 B D] Joseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel vs Reserve Bank of India & Ors., [1962] Suppl. 3 SCR 632; State of U.P. vs Babu Ram, ; ; D.V.K. Prasada Rao vs Govt. of A.P., AIR 1984 A.P. 75, relied on. The objects of the direction are to preserve the ability of the RNBC to pay back to subscribers/depostitors at any given 416 time; safety of the subscribers ' money and his right to unencumbered repayment are thus of paramount public interest and the directions aimed to protect them. The directions cannot and would not be adjudged to be ultra vires or arbitrary by reasons of successful financial management of an individual company. An overall view of the working system of the scheme is relevant and germane. [460 C D] 8. The obligation in paragraph 12 of periodical disclosure in the accounts of a company of the deposits together with the interest securd thereon, whether or not payable, but admittedly due as a liability, is to monitor the discipline of the operation of the schemes and any infraction, would be dealt with as per law. The certificate by a qualified Chartered Accountant is to vouchsafe the correctness and authenticity of accounts and would and should adhere to the statutory compliance. [460 D E] 9. The settled accounting practice is that a loan or deposit received from a creditor has to be shown as a liability together with accrued interest whether due or deferred. The actuarial accounting applies to revenues and costs to which the concept of the `going concern ' can be adopted. Therefore, in providing the costs of the company it can set apart its costs on the basis that liability is created for interest, bonus etc. payable in foreseeable future. Undoubtedly the actuarial principle applied by the LIC or the gratuity schemes are linked with life of the assured or the premature death before retirement of an employee, but RNBC in its contract does not undertake any such risk. The deposit or loan is a capital receipt but not a revenue receipt and its full value shall be shown in the account books or balance sheet as liability of the company. It cannot be credited to the profit and loss account. of Schedule I of the requires that the amount shown in the profit and loss account should be confined to the income and expenditure of the company. Para 12 of the directions is, thus, in consonance with the . Paragraph 6 only elongates the contract in the public interest to safeguard the interest of the vulnerable sections of the depositors. The RBI cannot be expected to constantly monitor the working of the RNBC in its day to day function. The actuarial basis cannot be adopted by the RNBCs. and the liability must always be reflected in its balance sheet at its full value. Compliance of the direction in para 12, dehors any method of accountancy adopted by a company, intended to discipline its operations. [460 E H, 461 A C] 417 10. Regulation includes total prohibition in a given case where the mischief to be remedied warrants total prohibition. The directions of 1987 are neither palpably arbitrary nor unjust nor unfair. The mechanism evolved in the directions is fool proof, to secure the interest of the depositors, as well as capable of monitoring the business management of every RNBC. It also protects the interest of the employees/field staff/commission agents etc. on permanent basis over coming initial convulsion. It was included, in the best possible manner, to subserve the interest of all without putting any prohibition in the ability of a company to raise the deposit, even the absence of any adequate paid up capital or reserve fund or such pre commitment of the owner, to secure such deposits. [462 E G] Narendra Kumar vs Union of India, ; , relied on. Reserve Bank of India etc. vs Peerless General Finance and Investment Co. Ltd. & Ors. ; , , referred to. So long as the power is traceable to the statute, mere omission to recite the provision does not denude the power of the legislature or rule making authority to make the regulations, nor consiered without authority of law. The asbsence of reiteration of objective satisfaction in the preamble as of one under Section 45L does not denude the powers; the RBI admittedly has the power under Section 45L, to justify the actions. Though Section 45L was neither expressly stated nor mentioned in the Preamble of the directions of the required recitation or satisfaction of objective facts to issue the directions, from the facts and circumstances it is demonstrated that the RBI, had such satisfaction in its consideration the power under Section 45L, when the directions were issued. Even otherwise Section 45K (3) itself is sufficient to uphold the directions. [464 F H] 1.2. The court has to see whether the scheme, measure or regulation adopted is relevant or appropriate to the power exercised by the authority. Prejudice to the interest of depositors is a relevant factor. Mismanagement or inability to pay the accrued liabilities are evils sought to be remedied. The directions of 1987 designed to preserve the right of the depositors and the ability of RNBC to pay back the contractual liability. It also intended to prevent mismanagement of the deposits collected from vulnerable social segments who have no knowledge of banking operations or credit system and repose unfounded blind faith on the company with fond hope of its ability to pay back the contracted amount. Thus the directions maintain 418 the thrift for saving and streamline and strengthen the monetary operations of RNBCs. [463 E G] \n",

            "Target: The constitutional validity of S.15B of Gujarat Sales Tax Act, S.3 AAAA of Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act and S.6A of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act was challenged in the present Appeals, Writ Petitions SLPs and Transferred case. S.15 B of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969 was introduced by Amendment Act, 1986. It provided for levy of additional purchase tax on raw materials purchased by a manufacturing dealer in case he used the said raw material for the manufacture of other goods which he despatched to his own place of business or to his agent 's place of business outside the State but within India. By the Amendment Act, 1987, the section was substituted. Writ Petitions were filed before the High Court challenging the validity of unamended S.15 B on the ground that it levied a consignment tax and hence was outside the competence of State Legislature. During the pendency of the writ petitions, S.15 B was substituted by an Ordinance. Subsequently the Gujarat Sales Tax Amendment Act 6 of 1990 was enacted in terms of and replacing the Ordinance. S.15 B was given retrospective effect from 1.4.1986, the date on which it first came into force. In view of the said Amendment Act, the Writ Petitions came to be dismissed as infructuous. A fresh batch of Writ Petitions were filed challenging the validity of substituted S.15 B on the ground that it continued to be a consignment tax. The High Court having dismissed the Writ Petitions, the matter has come up before this Court. Section 3 AAAA of the U.P. Sales Tax subjected the purchase Of \"goods liable to tax at the point of sale to the consumer\" to purchase tax payable by the purchasing dealer, in a case where the selling dealer was not liable to pay the sales tax on such sale. Purchase tax was payable at the same rate as the sales tax. If, however, the purchasing dealer resold such goods within the State or in the course of inter State trade or commerce, he was not liable to pay the purchase tax. While the Civil Appeals were pending in this Court as regards the validity of S.3 AAAA, the High Court, while deciding some Writ Petitions, applied the ratio in Good Year and held that section was ultra vires the legislative competence of the State Legislature. It held that under the said provision the taxable event was not the purchase of the goods by the purchasing dealer but the subsequent event namely use of the said goods in the manufacture of other goods and their despatch without effecting a sale within the State of U.P. to a place outside U.P. To overcome this decision an Ordinance was issued which was later replaced by the U.P. Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1992, the constitutional validity of which has been challenged before this Court. In the A.P. Sales Tax Act Section 6 A was inserted by the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act of 1976 with effect from 1.9.76. The effect was that tax payable at sale point became tax payable on purchase point in certain circumstances. Writ Petitions were filed before the High Court challenging the validity of S.6 A. It was contended that the notification issued under S.9 of the Act exempted from tax certain goods which were sought to be taxed under S.6 A and that S.6 A was in fact a consumption or consignment tax and hence void. Unable to succeed before the High Court, the assessees challenged the vires of the said section before this Court. Apart from challenging the constitutional validity of the above said provisions of the three State Sales Tax Acts, the correctness of Good Year India Ltd vs State of Haryana, ; which invalidated certain purchase tax levied by the Haryana and Maharashtra Sales Tax Acts, was also questioned by the Revenue before this Court. Dismissing the matters. this Court, HELD: (By the Court): S.15B of the Gujarat Sales Tax, 1969, S.3AAAA of Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act, 1948 and S.6 A of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 are intra vires the powers of the respective State Legislatures and hence valid. [249 D] Per B.P Jeevan Reddy, J: (for himself and V. Ramaswami, J.) 1. The necessity and significance of the delegated legislation is well accepted and needs no elaboration. They cannot travel beyond the purview of the Act. Where the Act says that Rules on being made be deemed \"as if enacted in this Act\", the position may be different. But where the Act does not say so, the Rules do not become part of the Act. [212 B, Cl Halsbury 's Laws of England (3rd. Edn.) Vol. 36, referred to. Entry 54 of List 11 of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution must receive a liberal construction, it being a legislative entry. The Legislature cannot be confined to only one form of levy. So long as the levy retains the basic character of a tax on sale, the Legislature can levy it in such mode or in such manner as it thinks appropriate, the well established principles in such matters being that reasonable construction should be followed and literal construction may be avoided if that defeats the manifest object and purpose of the Act. The Legislature must be presumed to know its limitations and act within those limits. Transgression must be clearly established, and is not to be lightly assumed. [214 H; 215 A, B] 3. A person other than a registered dealer is not amenable to the discipline of the Sales Tax Act. He cannot indeed collect any tax and, therefore, will not make over or pay any tax. This the legislature is justified in presuming. If, however, in any case it is proved that such person has paid the tax, the purchasing dealer will get an exemption to that extent. If a benefit is claimed by the purchasing dealer, it is for him to prove the fact which enables him to claim the benefit. That burden cannot be passed on to any one else. [222 C, D] 4. So far as registered dealers are concerned, all that the purchasing dealer need to prove is that the said goods have already been or may be subjected to tax under State Act or Central Sales Tax Act. On this score, there is no difficulty for the purchasing dealer. From the bill given by the selling dealer, the purchasing dealers can prove the payment. Or he can simply prove, as a matter of law that the said goods are liable to be taxed under any other provision of the Act or under the Central Sales Tax Act. [222 E, F] GUJARAT SALES TAX ACT/RULES: 5.1. S.15 B of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act read as a whole, is applicable only to those goods which are used in the manufacture of other goods. The levy is upon the purchase price of raw material an not upon the value of the manufactured products. [214 G, H] 5.2. Rule 14E of Gujarat Sales Tax Rules along with S.15B of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act provide for set off etc., in case the manufactured goods are sold within the State of Gujarat. It no doubt means that set off etc. is not available if the manufactured goods are disposed of otherwise than by way of sale or are consigned to manufacturer 's own depots or to the depots or his agents outside the State of Gujarat. There is nothing objectionable in the State doing so. It cannot be said that by reading Rule 42 E into S.15 B, the levy becomes a consignment tax. [213 E F] Godrej & Boyce Mfg.

Goodyear India Ltd. vs State of Haryana, ; , dissented from. Ramkrishna vs State of Bihar, A.l. R. 1963 S.C.1667, referred to. U.P. SALES TAX ACT: 6.1. All that section 3 AAAA of the U.P. Sales Tax Act prior to its substitution in 1992 provided was; (i) where the goods liable to tax at the point of sale to the consumer are sold to a dealer (ii) in circumstances in which no sales tax is payable by the sellers and (iii) the purchasing dealer does not re sell the said purchased goods within the State or in the course of inter state trade or commerce (iv) the purchasing dealer shall be liable to pay the tax which would have been payable by the seller. (v) If, however, it was proved that the said goods have already suffered tax under section 3 AAAA, no purchase tax was payable under section 3 AAAA. It is obvious that the section did not speak of the purchased goods being used in the manufacture of other goods nor of the manner of disposal or despatch of such manufactured goods. The only two conditions stipulated (which conditions are not to be found in the present Section 3 AAAA) were that if the purchased goods are sold within the State or sold in the course of inter state trade or commerce, the tax under it is not payable. This is for the simple reason that in both the contingencies, the State would get the revenue (in one case under the State Sales Tax Act and in the other case, under the Central Sales Tax Act). The policy of the legislature is not to tax the same goods twice over. The fact that in a given case, the purchased goods are consigned by the purchaser to his own depots or agents outside the State makes no difference to the nature and character of the tax. By doing so, he cannot escape even one time tax upon the goods purchased, which is the policy of the Legislature. The tax was directed towards ensuring levy of tax at least on one transaction of sale of the goods and not towards taxing the consignment of goods purchased or the products manufactured out of them. [223 G H; 224 A D] 6.2. There is no vagueness in the provision viz. sub sec.(2) of S.3 AAAA of U.P. Sales Tax Act nor can it be said that it placed heavy and uncalled for burden upon the purchasing dealer or that it is not practicable for the purchaser to establish that the seller (other than the registered dealer) has paid the tax or not. [222 B] 6.3. The difficulty has really arisen because of the attempt to look to the provisions of Section 3 AAAA through the prism of Goodyear. There is a substantial and qualitative difference between the language employed in Section 9 of Haryana Act and Section 13 AA of Bombay Act on the one hand and in Section 3 AAAA of U.P. Act on the other (as it stood prior to 1992 Amendment Act or for that matter as it stands now). These basic differences cannot be ignored. [1224 E] Constitutionality of Section 3 AAAA of the U.P. Sales Tax Act ought to be judged on its own language and so judged, the Section, both before and after the 1992 Amendment, represents a perfectly valid piece of legislation. It is relatable to and fully warranted by Entry 54 of List 11 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. [224 F] Goodyear India Ltd vs State of Haryana, ; , dissented from. ANDHRA PRADESH GENERAL SALES TAX ACT/RULES: 7.1. The real object of clauses (i) to (iii) in Section 6 A of the A.P. Sales Tax Act is not to levy a consumption tax, use tax or consignment tax but only to point out that thereby the purchasing dealer converts himself into the last purchaser in the state of such goods. The goods cease to exist or cease to be available in the State for sale or purchase attracting tax. In these circumstances, the purchasing dealer of such goods is taxed, if the seller is not or cannot be taxed. The tax imposed by S.6 A cannot be described either as use tax, consumption tax or consignment tax. It is a purchase tax perfectly warranted by Entry 54 of List ll of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. [230 G & 231 B] 7.2. While exempting the sale or purchase of any specified class of goods the Government is empowered to specify whether the exemption operates at all points or any specified points in the series of sales or purchase of successive dealers. Several notifications have been issued the Government from time to time exempting certain dealers or exempting certain goods at the point of sale or purchase, as the case may be. G.O.Ms. 1091 is one of them. The exemption is couched in qualified form. Thus, it is not a general exemption but a qualified one. In the light of the specific scheme of Section 9 of the A.P. Sales Tax Act and the language of G.O.Ms No. 1091, the exemption at the point of sale by a particular category of persons cannot be construed as operating to exempt the purchase tax under Section 6 A of the Act, as well, much less in all cases. [233 B, C] 7.3. Fresh milk was taxable as general goods under Section 5(l) of the Andhra Pradesh Sales Tax Act before it was amended by Amendment Act 4 of 1989. After the coming into force of the said Amendment Act, it falls under Schedule VII, (which was introduced simultaneously with the said Amendment Act) aud which takes in all goods other than those specified in first to sixth Schedules. Milk was subject to multi point tax prior to the said Amendment Act whereas after the said amendment it has become taxable only at single point namely, point of first sale in the State. If fresh milk was not at all taxable under the Act, there was no necessity to issue notifications exempting its sale in certain situations.[227 C D] Goodyear India Ltd. vs State of Haryana ; , dissented from. RATIO OF GOODYEAR RECONSIDERATION OF: 8.1. The ingredients of Section 9 of Haryana Sales Tax Act are: (i) a dealer liable to pay tax under the Act purchases goods (other than those specified in Schedule B) from any source in the State and (ii) uses them in the State in the manufacture of any other goods and (iii) either disposes of the manufactured goods in any manner otherwise than by way of sale in the State or despatches the manufactured to a place outside the State in any manner otherwise than by way of sale in the course of an inter state trade or commerce or in the course of export outside the territory of India within the meaning of sub section (1) of Section 5 of the . If all the above three ingredients are satisfied the dealer becomes liable to pay tax on the purchase of such goods at such rate, as may be notified under Section 15. It applies only in those cases where (a) the goods are purchased (referred to as material) by a dealer liable to pay tax under the Act in the State, (b) the goods so purchased cease to exist as such goods for the reason they are consumed in the manufacture of different commodities and (c) such manufactured commodities are either disposed of within the State otherwise than by way of sale or despatched to a place outside the State otherwise than by way of sale or despatched to a place outside the State otherwise than by way of an inter State sale or export sale. It is evident that if such manufactured goods are not sold within the State of Haryana, but yet disposed of within the State no tax is payable on such disposition; similarly where manufactured goods are despatched out of State as a result of an inter State sale or export sale no tax is payable on such sale. Similarly against where such manufactured goods are taken out of State to manufacturers own depots or to the depots of his agents no tax is payable on such removal. Goodyear takes only the last eventuality and holds that the taxable event is the removal of goods from the State and since such removal is to dealers own depots/agents outside the State it is consignment which cannot be taxed by the State Legislature. This is not correct. The levy created by the said provision is a levy on the purchase of raw material purchased within the State which is consumed in the manufacture of other goods within the State. If however the manufactured goods are sold within the State no purchase tax is collected on the raw material evidently because the State gets larger revenue by taxing the sale of such goods. (The value of manufactured goods is bound to be higher than the value of the raw material). The State Legislature does not wish to in the interest of trade and general public tax both the raw material and the finished (manufactured) product. This is a well known policy in the field of taxation. But where the manufactured goods are not sold within the State but are yet disposed of or where the manufactured goods are sent outside the State (otherwise than by way of inter State sale or export sale) the tax has to be paid on the purchase value of the raw material. The reason is simple: if the manufactured goods are disposed of otherwise than by sale within the State or are sent out of State (i.e. consigned to dealers own depots or agents) the State does not get any revenue because no sale of manufactured goods has taken place within Haryana. In such a situation the State would retain the levy and collect it since there is no reason for waiving the purchase tax in these two situations. [239 B D; 240 A D] 8.2. In the case of inter State sale the State of Haryana does get the tax revenue may not be to the full extent. Though the Central Sales Tax is levied and collected by the Government of India Article 269 of the Constitution provides for making over the tax collected to the State in accordance with certain principles. Where of course the sale is an export sale within the meaning of Section 5 (1) of the (export sales) the State may not get any revenue but larger national interest is served thereby. It is for these reasons that tax on the purchase of raw material is waived in these two situations. Thus, there is a very sound and consistent policy underlying the provision. The object is to tax the purchase of goods by a manufacturer whose existence as such goods is put and end to by him by using them in the manufacture of different goods in certain circumstances. The tax is levied upon the purchase price of raw material, not upon the sale price or consignment value of manufactured goods. Levy materialises only when the purchased goods (raw material) is consumed in the manufacture of different goods and those goods are disposed of within the State otherwise than by way of sale or are consigned to the manufacturing dealers ' depots/agents outside the State of Haryana. Such postponement does not convert what is avowedly a purchase tax on raw material (levied on the purchase price of such raw material) to a consignment tax on the manufactured goods. Saying otherwise would defeat the very object and purpose of Section 9 and amount to its nullification in effect. The most that can perhaps be said is that it is plausible to characterise the said tax both as purchase tax as well as consignment tax. But where two interpretations are possible, one which sustains the consititutionality and/or effectuates its purpose and intendment and the other which effectively nullifies the provisions, the former must be preferred, according to all known canons of interpretation. [240 E H; 241 A C] 8.3. In several enactments tax is levied at the last sale point or last purchase point, as the case may be. The last purchase point in the State can be determined only when one knows that no purchase took place within the State thereafter. But that can only be known later. If there is a subsequent purchase within the State, the purchase in question ceases to be the last purchase. Applying the logic of the dealers, it would not be possible to tax any goods at the last purchase point in the State, inasmuch as the last purchase point in regard to any goods could be determined only when the goods are sold later and not when the goods are purchased. [241 F G] 8.4. The scheme of Section 9 of Haryana Sales Tax Act is to levy the tax on purchase of raw material and not to forego it where the goods manufactured out of them are disposed of (or despatched, as the case may be) in a manner not yielding any revenue to the State nor serving the interests of the nation and its economy. The purchased goods are put an end to by their consumption in manufacture of other goods and yet the manufactured goods are dealt with in a manner as to deprive the State of any revenue; in such cases, there is no reason why the State should forego its tax revenue on purchase of raw material. It would not be right to say that the tax is not upon the purchase of raw material but on the consignment of the manufactured goods. It is well settled that taxing power can be utilised to encourage commerce and industry. It can also be used to serve the interests of economy and promote social and economic planning. It is also not right to concentrate only on one situation viz., consignment of goods to manufacturer 's own depots (or to the depots of his agents) outside the State. Disposal of goods within the State without effecting a sale also stands on the same footing, an instance of which may be captive consumption of manufactured products in the manufacture of yet other products. Once the scheme and policy of the provision is appreciated, there is no room for saying that the tax is on the consignment of manufactured goods.[243 G H; 244 A F] 8.5. When the tax is levied on the purchase of raw material, on the purchase price and not on the manufacture of goods or on the consignment value (such a concept is unknown to Haryana Act) or sale price of the manufactured goods the construction placed in Goodyear runs against the very grain of the provision and has the effect of nullifying the very provision. By placing the said interpretation, Section 9 has been rendered nugatory. The tax purports to be and is in truth a purchase tax levied on the purchase price of raw material purchased by a manufacturer. [247 A C] 8.6.S. 13AA of the Bombay Sales Tax Act is substantially similar to Section 9 of Haryana Sales Tax Act. Whatever is said with respect to the Haryana provision applies equally to this provision.

Per Ranganathan, J. (Concurring): 1. The provisions of the U.P. and Gujarat Sales Tax Acts are clearly beyond challenge. The section in the U.P. Act is a very direct and simple provision to the effect that a tax will be levied on purchases made within the State in certain circumstances. The ambit of Entry 54 in the State List in the Constitution of India must be interpreted in the widest possible manner. The State has full powers to levy a tax with reference to sales or purchases inside the State and to a certain extent even sales made in the course of inter State trade or commerce. It certainly comprehends a power to tax the last sale in the State of certain goods. The tax is nothing but a tax on purchase, pure and simple, well within the scope of the State 's Legislative power. It is true that one has to look at not merely the form but the substance of the statute and examine what exactly is the purport behind the levy, but should not permit one 's imagination to read a purpose or words into the statute which are not there. 1198 C G] 2. The Gujarat provision is more careful but makes a mention of the purchased goods being used for manufacture. But, these are only words descriptive of a class of goods the purchase of which is sought to be brought to tax. Here again, the intention of the legislature is to tax, at purchase point, a class of goods viz. goods purchased by a manufacturer. It has no concern, with what the manufacturer does with the manufactured goods. Presumably the idea is that the manufacturer is able to profit by adding value to the purchased raw material by utilising the infrastructure, fillips or facilities provided in the State to encourage setting up of industries therein and so can afford to pay tax on the purchased raw materials. The concession provided by rule 42E of the Gujarat Sales Tax Rules is an independent provision relieving him and the public consuming the manufactured goods of additional burden where such goods are sold inside the State and get taxed on the added value. [198 H; 199 A, B] 3. The marginal title to the provisions under challenge indicates that their direct purpose is to levy a tax on purchases effected in the State in certain circumstances. The tax is couched as a tax on all goods (in U.P.) and on raw or processing materials and consumable stores (in the State of Gujarat). It is designated as a purchase tax. It is levied on the turnover of such purchases. There is no reference in the U.P. statute to any condition for imposition of the tax except that it should be a sale to the consumer and in the State of Gujarat that it should be a purchase by a manufacturer. It is very difficult to read into these provisions any ulterior motive on the part of the States to levy a tax on use, consumption or consignment in the guise of a purchase tax. The language of these two provisions is wholly different from that used in the Haryana and Bombay Acts. Even in the context of those Acts, it may be equally plausible to consider the provisions either as a purchase tax or a tax on consignment. There is no such ambiguity in the language used in these provisions, and the levy is only of a purchase tax. Such a levy is clearly within the domain of the State Legislature. [199 C F] 4. A person can be said to be the last purchaser of certain goods only when he consumes those goods himself or, in case they are raw materials/stores and the like, unless he uses them in the manufacture of other goods for sale. From this category have to be excluded cases where the manufactured goods are either sold in the State or sold in the course of inter State trade or commerce because, in those two instances, the State will be in a position to collect the tax in respect of the sale of the manufactured goods the sale price of which will also include the price of raw materials on which apriori the State could have only got a lesser amount of tax and to tax both would escalate the price and affect the consumer. Also excluded are cases where the manufactured goods are exported abroad to earn foreign currency. If these situations are borne in mind, one would realise that the language used in the various clauses and phrases used in these legislations is only to levy a tax on the last purchase in the State and not with a view to levy a tax either on the use or consumption of raw materials or on the manufacture or production of manufactured goods or on the despatch of the goods manufactured from the State otherwise than by way of sale. In the Haryana case also the statute mentioned these several alternatives but a consideration of section 9(1)(b) of the Haryana Act as well as of the corresponding clause of the Bombay Act were posed in isolation and emphasis placed on consignment being a sine qua non of the levy. This larger concept, namely, that these various alternatives are not set out in the section with a view to fasten the charge of tax at the point of use, consumption, manufacture, production and consignment or despatch but in an attempt to make clear that what is sought to be levied is a tax on raw materials on the occasion of their last purchase inside the State had not been projected or considered. This approach would basically alter the parameters and remove the provision from the area of vulnerability. [200 F H; 201 A D] 5. It is difficult to define a last purchase except with reference to the mode of the use of the purchased goods subsequent to that purchase and in that sense the levy of tax can crystallise only at a point of time when the goods have been utilised in a particular way. The mere fact that the purchase cannot be characterised as a last purchase except by reference to the subsequent utilisation of those goods cannot mean that the taxable event is not the purchase but something else. The more appropriate test would be to see whether the ambit of the power to levy a tax in respect of sale of goods is very wide and will cover any tax which has a nexus with the sale or purchase of goods including a last purchase in the State. In this view of the matter the levy under the A.P. Act is also within the legislative competence of the State. , B] 6. The conclusion reached as to the vires of the provisions under challenge is contrary to the conclusion reached in Goodyear on somewhat analogous provisions. No final conclusion is expressed as to whether the conclusion in Goodyear was rightly reached in the context of the provisions of the statutes considered there, or would need a second look and fresh consideration in the context of what has been said now. There is no hesitation to accept the point of view now presented and which appeals to be more realistic, appropriate and preferable, particularly the view one way or the other would affect the validity of a large number of similar legislations all over India, merely because it may not be consistent with the view taken in Goodyear. Consistency, for the mere sake of it, is no virtue. [202 C, D] Distributors (Baroda) P. Ltd. vs Union of India, (1985 )155 I.T.R. 120 S.C., relied on.

The provisions of the Gujarat sales tax Act, U. P. Sales Tax, and the Ors. General sales Tax Act were in effect from the date of the enactment of the Act. In the instant case, the State of Haryana was a party to the Gujarat sale tax Act.

He was arrested next day From February 23, 1965 when he was arrested to February 2, 1965, he was in police custody and thereafter sent to jail. The Assistant Surgeon, the Civil Surgeon, and the Psychiatrist of the mental hospital to which he was referred reported that he was depressed and silent. According to the Psychiatrist he was a lunatic in terms of the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912. At is trial under section 435 of the Indian Penal Code two of his relatives appeared as defence witnesses and testified that he was mentally unsound. The trial Magistrate acquitted the accused on the finding that the appellant fell within the general exception in section 84 of the Indian Penal Code. The High Court, in appeal filed by the State, reversed the judgment. In appeal by special leave, HELD : It is now well settled that the crucial point of time at which unsoundness of mind should be established is the time when the crime was committed. The burden of proving this lies on the accused though the burden is no higher than that which rests upon a party to civil preceedings. [252 E] State of Madya Pradesh vs Ahmadulla, ; and D. C. Thakker vs State of Gujarat, ; , referred to. In the present case the appellant had discharged the burden. There was no reason why the defence witnesses should not be believed. They were no doubt relations of the appellant but it is the relations who are likely to remain in intimate contact. The behaviour of the appellant on the day of occurrence, failure of the police to lead evidence as to his condition when the appellant was in custody, and the medical evidence indicated that the appellant was insane within the meaning of section 84 I.P.C.[256 D] The High Court was wrong in drawing an adverse inference against the accused on the ground that he had not produced any expert medical evidence in defence. This could not be expected from a poor villager specially in view of the certificates issued by the medical authorities after he was arrested. [2 55 C] The High Court 's observation that the appellant appeared to be of normal understanding and the fact that he had given intelligent answers. to questions under section 342 Cr.

            "Target: Under Rule 2 of the Bihar Public Works Department Code, the Governor of Bihar took a decision on 7.4.1958 providing that 25% of the posts of Assistant Engineers in the Bihar Engineering Service, Class II (the Service) were to be filled by promotion, subject to availability of suitable hands, from Overseers in the Bihar Subordinate Engineering Service (Irrigation Department) and 75% of the posts were to be filled by direct recruitment to the Service. Respondents No. 1 to 5 in both these appeals were appointed as Assistant Engineers in the Service on the recommendation of the Bihar Public Service Commission in the year 1961; and the appellants (in Civil Appeal No. 233 of 1978(respondents No. 6 to 23 in Civil Appeal No. 232 of 1978), who had been working as Overseers in the Bihar Subordinate Engineering Service (Irrigation Department) were promoted to the posts of Assistant Engineers in the Service in 1962 and thereafter. However, by orders dated 12.7.1975, 20.1.1976 and 9.4.1977, the Government changed the date of promotion of the appellants to the dates prior to the appointment of respondents No. 1 to 5 in the Service, making the former Senior to the letter. Respondents No. 1 to 5 filed writ petition before the High Court challenging the seniority conferred on the appellants from the retrospective date and contended that the orders giving promotions to the appellants from a date earlier to date of their promotion in the Service purported to affect prejudicially respondents No. 1 to 5 's right inasmuch as they were appointed to the Service earlier to the promotion of the appellants; and that the seniority had to be reckoned amongst the officials working as Assistant Engineers in the Service from the date of their appointment or promotion to the said Service. The appellants contended that they were entitled to be promoted retrospectively on the 411 basis of reservation of 25% of the Cadre posts in the Service till 1958. The High Court. holding that the orders promoting the appellants with retrospective effect were bad, quashed the same and allowed the writ petition. Hence the present appeals. On consideration of the legality and validity of the orders of the Government giving promotions to the appellants from a date earlier to the date of their entry into the Service as Assistant Engineers, and its effect on the inter se seniority amongst the appellants and respondents No. 1 to 5, who were directly appointed as Assistant Enginers in the Service before the appellants entered in the said Service. Dismissing the appeals, this Court, HELD: 1. The Government Orders dated 12.7.1975, 20.1.1976 and 9.4.1977 which purported to give promotion to the appellants retrospectively were arbitrary, illegal and inoperative inasmuch as these seriously affected rspondents No. 1 to 5. The appellants were not borne in the cadre of Assistant Engineers even in officiating capacity at time when rspondents No. 1 to 5 were directly recruited to the post of Assistant Egineer. As such, the promotee appellants could not be under any circumstance given seniority over the directly recruited respondents No. 1 to 5. The judgment of the High Court in quashing the impugned Government Orders was, therefore, unexceptionable. [418F H; 420A] 2.1 No person can be promoted with retrospective effect from a date when he was not borne in the Cadre so as to adversely affect others; and amongst members of the same grade, seniority is reckoned from the date of their initial entry into the service. [419F] 2.2 Seniority inter se amongst the Assistant Engineers in Bihar Engineering Service, Class II would be considered from the date of the length of service rendered as Assistant Engineers. Therefore, the appellants could not be made senior to respondents No. 1 to 5 by the impugned Government Orders as they entered into the said Service in 1962 and thereafter by promotion subsequent to respondent No. 1 to 5 who were directly recruited in the quota meant for them. There was nothing to show that the appellants could be deemed to be recruited in 1958 quota and that these vacancies were carried forward. [419G; 418E F] A.K.

Thereafter, the Regional Transport Authority, on its proper constitution, did not issue a fresh Notification section 57 (2) of the inviting fresh applications but granted a stage carriage permit to the appellant on the basis of applications received in pursuance of the earlier Notification. On appeal by the aggrieved applicants the Appellate Authority set aside the said order and instead granted the permit to respondent No. 4. The appellant 's revision application before the State Government having been failed, he filed a writ petition in the High Court against the order of the State Government on the grounds, (i) that at the time when the earlier Notification was issued section 57(2), the delegation of power by the invalidly constituted Authority to its Secretary to issue such Notification would be invalid and therefore the further proceedings adopted for consideration of such applications and grant of permits pursuant to such consideration was invalid; and (ii) that on merits the Appellate Authority ought not to have interfered with the five marks that had been granted to the appellant by the Regional Transport Authority and reduced the same to three and further that the Appellate Authority ought not to have relied upon the only solitary adverse entry in the appellant 's record to reject his application while preferring that of respondent No. 4. The High Court also dismissed the writ petition. The appellant advanced the same contentions before the Supreme Court, Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: (1) The first contention is liable to be rejected on three grounds, namely, (i) It was not disputed that applications under section 57 (2) of the Act for the grant of stage carriage permits could be filed voluntarily and without any Notification being issued in that behalf. If that be so, the question whether a fresh Notification inviting fresh applications by the properly constituted Regional 805 Transport Authority ought to have bean issued or not or whether the properly A constituted Regional 'transport Authority could proceed to act on the earlier Notification issued by the Secretary would be immaterial and of no consequence and the ultimate decision not to grant stage carriage permit to the appellant cannot be disturbed on this ground; (ii) The non issuance of a fresh Notification by the properly constituted Regional Transport Authority could, if at all, be made a ground of attack by those persons who were unable to make applications because of such non issuance and not by the appellant who had made an application in that behalf and who took his chance to obtain the permit on the basis of his application which was in fact considered by the Regional Transport Authority and thereafter by the Appellate Authority; and (iii) The initial order granting the permit to the appellant was passed by a properly constituted Regional Transport Authority and the appellate order was also passed by State Transport Appellate Tribunal which was the properly constituted Appellate Authority and both these authorities had passed their orders on a consideration of the entire material placed before each of them and after giving a full hearing to the appellant and as such no failure of justice had occassioned. [807C F; H; 8U8A] (2) This Court will not be justified in interfering in the matter on merits, since the High Court has rightly taken the view, (i) that the second contention really pertained to the merits of the claim of the appellant to the stage carriage permit and it could not interfere with the finding of fact recorded against the appellant in that behalf in exercise of its extra ordinary jurisdiction under article 226 of the Constitution; and (ii) that the grounds on which the marks of the appellant were reduced and the reasons for ultimate rejection of the appellant 's application were justified.

            "Target: The assessee firm sold its assets to two companies and discontinued its business with effect from 1st February 1948. For the assessment year 1949 50 the income tax department sought to assess, under section 12B of the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, the capital gains made by the asessee. Capital gains under the section are computed, in a case (a) where there is no dispute about the market value of the asset on the date of transfer and (b) where the assessee has exercised the option under the third proviso to the section to adopt the value of the asset on 1st January 1939 as its actual cost, by deducting from the market value of the asset on the date of transfer the value of the asset on January 1, 1939. In the present case the department accepted the market value of the assets on February 1, 1948, the date of transfer, and estimated the value of the assets on 1st January 1939, at a certain figure, and brought to tax the difference between the two, rejecting the assessee 's claim under section 25(3) to the benifit of exemption from taxability arising from discontinuance of the business. The Appellate Tribunal confirmed the order. It rejected the contention of the assessee that the evidence on the record showed that the market value of some of the assets on 1st January 1939 exceeded the value as estimated by the department and that therefore the capital gains to be taxed would be much less, by merely recording a bare conclusion that the value of the assets on 1st January 1939 could not be more than the estimated value, without considering the evidence. The High Court, on reference, (1) held against the.assessee that it was not entitled to the benefit under section 25(3), and (2) held aginst the department that the Tribunal misdirected itself in not considering the evidence produced before the Income tax Authorities regarding the valuation on 1st January 1939. The assessee and the Commissioner of Income tax appealed to this Court. HELD : (1) It is only income earned by carrying on business that is entitled to exemption under section 25(3). Capital gains, though by the definition in section 2(6C) are income and liable to tax by virtue of section 6 read with section 12B, not being income which arises from a trading activity, are not entitled to such exemption.

While the onus lies upon the 9 7 2 assessee to prove the market value of the assets on January 1, 1939 the Tribunal, in disposing of the appeal under section 33(4) of the Act, is bound to hear the parties and consider the entire evidence produced before the Income tax Authorities.

            "Target: The land belonging to the respondent intermediaries comprising of certain plots stood vested in the State of West Bengal by operation of a Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953. Since the plots were recorded as 'tank fisheries ' (used as pisciculture), they stood excluded from the purview of the vesting Notification under Section 6(1)(e) of the Act and preserved to the respondent intermediaries. Subsequently the primary authority the Assistant Set tlement Officer initiated suo moto proceedings by issuing notice to the respon 92 dents under Section 44(2a) of the Act for correction of classification of lands on the ground that the plots were wrongly recorded as fishery plots. The respondents objected to reclassification of the lands by contending that in 1952 they were granted Dakhilas to the said land by one `B ', the Principal landlady, and thereafter they have been cultivat ing pisciculture on the said plots of the land and conduct ing fishery business. The Assistant Settlement Officer rejected the claim of the respondents and ordered reclassi fication of the plots. The respondents filed an appeal before the Tribunal (District Judge) under section 44(3) of the Act. The Appellate Tribunal reversed the order of the Assistant Settlement Officer and confirmed the original classification of the plots. Against the decision of the Appellate Tribunal, the State filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court which dismissed the petition in limine. In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the State: (i) that the Appellate Tribunal had reversed the findings without considering the validity of the reasons recorded by the Assistant Settlement Officer; (ii) that the Appellate Tribunal had taken irrelevant factor or non exist ing factors into account and thereby its findings were based on no evidence and hence vitiated in law. On behalf of the respondents it was contended that since the Appellate Authority has recorded the findings of fact that pisciculture was in existence as on the date of vesting the Supreme Court cannot interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the Appellate Court, particularly, when the High Court did not choose to interfere with the finding. Allowing the Appeal, this Court, HELD: 1. Giving of reasons is an essential element of administration of justice. A right to reason is, therefore, an indispensable part of sound system of judicial review. Reasoned decision is not only for the purpose of showing that the citizen is receiving justice, but also a valid discipline for the Tribunal itself. Therefore, statement of reasons is one of the essentials of justice. [99C D] 1.1 The appellate authority in particular a trained and experienced District Judge is bound to consider the entire material evidence adduced and relied on by the parties and to consider whether the reasons assigned by the primary authority is cogent, relevant to the 93 point in issue and based on material evidence on record. The appellate authority being final authority on facts, is enjoined and incumbent upon it to appreciate the evidence; consider the reasoning of the primary authority and assign its own reasons as to why it disagrees with the reasons and findings of the primary authority. Unless adequate reasons are given, merely because it is an appellate authority, it cannot brush aside the reasoning or findings recorded by the primary authority. [99D; 102E F] 2. If the appellate authority had appreciated the evi dence on record and recorded the findings of fact, those findings are binding on this Court or the High Court. By process of judicial review this Court cannot appreciate the evidence and record its own findings of fact. If the find ings are based on no evidence or based on conjectures or surmises and no reasonable man would, on given facts and circumstances, come to the conclusion reached by the appel late authority on the basis of the evidence on record, certainly this Court would oversee whether the findings recorded by the appellate authority is based on no evidence or beset with surmises or conjectures. [99A C] 2.1 In the instant case the Appellate Tribunal disre garded the material evidence on record, kept it aside, indulged in fishing expedition and crashed under the weight of conjectures and surmises. The appellate order is, there fore, vitiated by manifest and patent error of law apparent on the face of record. The order of Appellate Tribunal is quashed and the order of Assistant Settlement Officer is restored. [103F G; 104D] 3. Tank fishery means the lands being used for piscicul ture or any fishing in a reservoir or storage place whether formed naturally or by artificial contrivance as a permanent measure except such portion of embankment as are included in a homestead or in a garden or orchard to be tank fishery. Such lands occupied by pisciculture or fishing stand pre served to the intermediaries and thus stands excluded from the operation of sections 4 and 5 of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act, 1953. But the crucial date for establish ing, as a fact that the pisciculture was being carried on in the disputed land is the period of vesting. The existence of fishery subsequent to that period is not of any relevance. [100G H; 101E] Chamber 's 20th Century Dictionary, page 829; Webster comprehensive Dictionary, Vol. II and Stroud 's Judicial Dictionary, Vol. II 4th Edn., page 1051, referred to. 94 3.1 In the instant case the respondents did not produce before the Assistant Settlement Officer either post or pre record till date of vesting to establish that from 1952 to 1955 56 i.e. from the date of obtaining settlement till date of vesting, the lands were recorded in settlement records as pisciculture of fishery. Therefore, there is no documentary evidence to establish that the lands were being used, on the date of settlement or also on the date of vesting, as pisci culture or fishery. [101F; 102A] 4. Admittedly the High Court did not go into any of the questions raised by the appellant in the writ petition. It summarily dismissed the writ petition.

            "Target: The respondent was manufacturing printed bulb cartons and printed tube cartons for the purpose of packing electric bulbs and electric tube light. The Additional Collector of Central Excise held that the cartons manufactured by the respondent were classifiable under item No. 17 of the Cen tral Excise Tariff Act and thus chargeable to excise duty. Accordingly an order was passed for demand of excise duty. The respondent filed an appeal before the Customs, Excise & Gold (Control) Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal allowed the appeal by holding that (i) The product drums or sleeves manufactured by the respondent could not be called 'box ' or 'carton '; (ii) They were exempted from excise duty under the relevant notification. Hence this appeal by the Revenue. Dismissing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1. To consider the question whether the exemption notification was applicable or not in view of its terms, it is necessary to find out whether these sleeves bulbs or sleeves or tube light sleeves manufactured for the purpose of packing the electric bulbs and tubes are printed box and cartons. [127E] 2. The Tribunal approached the question from the literal meaning as well as the functional use of the expressions employed. As these 124 sleeves and tube sleeves manufactured by the respondent had no independent market as such, and as these were utilised for captive consumption for the end product manufactured by the respondent, in the absence of any positive and reliable evidence that there was either a market for these goods manufactured by the respondent, and in that market these bulb sleeves and tube sleeves are known and marketable as corrugated boxes and cartons, a fact of which in the record, there is no positive evidence either way, the Tribunal proceeded on a correct basis.

            "Target: This appeal concerns the circumstances in which an arbitrator in an international arbitration may appear to be biased. It raises important questions about the duty of impartiality and obligation of arbitrators to make disclosure. The appeal relates to an arbitration under a liability insurance policy which arose out of damage caused by an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. BP Exploration and Production Inc. (BP) was the lessee of the Deepwater Horizon rig. Transocean Holdings LLC (Transocean) owned the rig and provided crew and drilling teams to BP. The appellant, Halliburton Company (Halliburton) provided cementing and well monitoring services to BP. Halliburton had entered into a Bermuda Form liability policy with the respondent, Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd (Chubb\"). Transocean was also insured with Chubb by a Bermuda Form policy. The Deepwater Horizon disaster resulted in numerous claims against BP, Transocean and Halliburton. Following a trial in the US in which judgment was given apportioning blame between the parties, Halliburton settled the claims against it. Halliburton then sought to claim against Chubb under the liability policy. Chubb refused to pay contending that Halliburtons settlement was not a reasonable settlement. Transocean made a similar claim against Chubb and Chubb likewise contested Transoceans claim. The Bermuda Form policies provided for disputes to be resolved by arbitration. Halliburton commenced arbitration. Halliburton and Chubb each selected one arbitrator but were unable to agree on the appointment of a third arbitrator as chairman. As a result, after a contested hearing in the High Court, Mr Rokison, proposed by Chubb to the court, was appointed. Subsequently and without Halliburtons knowledge, Mr Rokison accepted appointment as an arbitrator in two separate references also arising from the Deepwater Horizon incident. The first appointment was made by Chubb and related to Transoceans claim against Chubb. The second was a joint nomination by the parties involved in a claim by Transocean against another insurer. On discovering Mr Rokisons appointment in the later references, Halliburton applied to the court under section 24 of the Arbitration Act 1996 to remove Mr Rokison as an arbitrator. That application was refused. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found that, while Mr Rokison ought to have disclosed his proposed appointment in the subsequent references, an objective observer would not in the circumstances conclude there was a real possibility Mr Rokison was biased. The appeal was therefore dismissed. Halliburton renews its challenge before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. It holds, for reasons which differ in part from courts below, that as at the date of the hearing to remove Mr Rokison, the fair minded and informed observer would not conclude that circumstances existed that gave rise to justifiable doubts about Mr Rokisons impartiality. Lord Hodge gives the leading judgment with whom Lord Reed, Lady Black and Lord Lloyd Jones agree. Lady Arden gives a concurring judgment. The law The duty of impartiality is a core principle of arbitration law [49]. In English law, the duty applies equally to party appointed arbitrators and independently appointed arbitrators [63]. In considering an allegation of apparent bias against an arbitrator, the test is whether the fair minded and informed observer would conclude there is a real possibility of bias [52, 55]. The courts will apply that objective test, having regard to the particular characteristics of international arbitration, including the private nature of most arbitrations [56 68]. The duty of disclosure is not simply good arbitral practice but is a legal duty in English law. It is a component of the arbitrators statutory obligations of fairness and impartiality [78]. The legal duty of disclosure does not, however, override the arbitrators duty of privacy and confidentiality in English law. Where information which needs to be disclosed is subject to a duty of confidentiality, disclosure can only be made if the parties owed confidentiality obligations give their consent. Such consent may be express but may also be inferred from the arbitration agreement itself in the context of the custom and practice in the relevant field of arbitration [88 104]. The arbitrators duty of disclosure is to disclose matters which might reasonably give rise to justifiable doubts as to his or her impartiality [107 116]. A failure to disclose relevant matters is a factor for the fair minded and informed observer to take into account in assessing whether there is a real possibility of bias[117 118]. In assessing whether an arbitrator has failed in a duty to make disclosure, the fair minded and informed observer will have regard to the facts and circumstances as at and from the time the duty arose [119 120]. In contrast, in assessing whether there is a real possibility that an arbitrator is biased, the fair minded and informed observer will have regard to the facts and circumstances known at the time of the hearing to remove the arbitrator [121 123]. The issues in this appeal There may be circumstances where the acceptance of multiple appointments involving a common party and the same or overlapping subject matter gives rise to an appearance of bias. Whether it does so will depend on the facts of the case and, in particular, the customs and practice in the relevant field of arbitration [127 131]. Where, as in the context of a Bermuda Form arbitration, the circumstances might reasonably give rise to a conclusion that there was a real possibility of bias, the arbitrator is under a legal duty to disclose such appointments unless the parties to arbitration have agreed otherwise [132 136]. Applying those conclusions to the facts, Mr Rokison was under a legal duty to disclose his appointment in the subsequent reference involving Chubb and Transocean. At the time of his appointment, the existence of potentially overlapping arbitrations with only one common party, Chubb, might reasonably have given rise to a real possibility of bias [145]. In failing to make that disclosure Mr Rokison breached his duty of disclosure [147]. However, having regard to the circumstances known at the date of the hearing at first instance, it could not be said that the fair minded and informed observer would infer from Mr Rokisons failure to make disclosure that there was a real possibility of bias. At the time, it had not been clear that there was a legal duty of disclosure. Secondly, the Transocean arbitrations had commenced several months after the Halliburton arbitration. Thirdly, Mr Rokisons measured response to Halliburtons challenge explained that it was likely the subsequent references would be resolved by a preliminary issue (as they in fact were) and that, if they were not, he would consider resigning from the Transocean arbitrations. There was therefore no likelihood of Chubb gaining any advantage by reason of overlapping references. Fourthly, there was no question of his having received any secret financial benefit, and, fifthly, there was no basis for inferring any unconscious ill will on his part. As a result, Halliburtons appeal fails [149 150]. Lady Ardens concurring judgment Lady Arden agrees with Lord Hodges judgment but makes a few further points to reinforce or, in some instances, qualify the conclusions reached. The duty of disclosure is a secondary obligation arising from the arbitrators primary duty to act fairly and impartially [160]. Unless the arbitration is one where there is an accepted practice of dispensing with the need to obtain parties consent to further appointments, the arbitrator should proceed on the basis that a proposed further appointment involving a common party and overlapping subject matter is likely to require disclosure of a possible conflict of interest [164]. The duty of disclosure is rooted in the duty of impartiality but is also an implied (if not express) term of the arbitrators appointment [167]. The parties can therefore agree to waive any objection to a conflict of interest, but disclosure is only an option if the conflict is one which would not prevent the arbitrator from acting impartially [168, 170]. Confidentiality is an important and free standing implied term [173 175]. But, in general, high level disclosure about a proposed appointment in a further arbitration can be made without any breach of confidentiality by naming only the common party (who may be taken to have consented to disclosure) but not the other parties to the arbitration [183 187]. \n",
            "Prediction: Halliburton entered into a Bermuda Form liability policy (the Policy) with ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd (Chubb) in 1992 and the Policy was renewed annually. Chubb and the three arbitrators involved in the arbitration which I discuss below are the defendants in this action to remove one of the arbitrators. The appeal raises questions of law of general importance in the field of arbitration and both the arbitration and the arbitral award are not generally a matter of public record. In England and Wales, the rules of procedure (CPR rule 62.10) empower the court to order that a claim under the Arbitration Act 1996 (the 1996 Act) or otherwise affecting arbitration proceedings or an arbitration agreement be heard in public or in private but create a norm that such claims are heard in private.

            "Target: This was an appeal by the defendants in a suit for possession on redemption of certain mortgages instituted in the Court of the Special judge exercising jurisdiction under the Sangli State Agriculturists Protection Act (1 of 1936). Their case was that the mortgaged properties had been sold at auction and purchased by their father who had sold most of them to other persons more than 12 years before the institution of the suit and as such the suit was barred by limitation. The trial Court dismissed the suit. On appeal the High Court of Sangli permitted the plaintiff to amend the plaint originally filed so as to include the relief for redemption and remanded the suit. The trial court, thereafter, decreed the suit in part, holding that the claim in respect of portions only of the mortgaged properties was barred by limitation. Both the parties appealed to the High Court of Bombay and the appeals were heard together. The High Court dismissed the defendant 's appeal and allowed the plaintiff 's appeal holding that article 148 and not article I34 Of the Limitation Act applied. In the result, the plaintiff 's suit was decreed in its entirety. Held, that the preliminary objection that the Special judge had no jurisdiction under the Sangli State Agriculturists Protection Act to entertain the suit must be overruled. The fixing of ,915 as the date line by the Act had reference to such reliefs as could be had only by way of reopening of closed transactions and could not, therefore, preclude the Special Judge from granting other reliefs in respect of transactions entered into prior to 1915. Nor could it be contended in bar that the plaintiff was bound in the first instance to set aside an auction sale of the mortgaged properties in execution of a money decree in which she was not substituted in place of her deceased father as his true heir and legal representative nor made a party and no controversy was raised by the parties nor decided by the Court as to who was the true legal representative. The plaintiff was entitled to ignore the sale and the suit was not barred under article 12 of the Limi tation Act. 480 Malkarjun Bin Shidramappa Pasare vs Narhari Bin Shivappa, (1900) L.R. 27 I.A. 216, doubted and distinguished. In order that article I34 of the Limitation Act might be attracted to a suit for possession on redemption, it was necessary for the defendant to prove affirmatively that the mortgagee or his succesor in interest had transferred a larger interest than was justified by the mortgage. Where, as in the present case, this was not done, article 134 could not apply and the only other article which could apply was article 148 Of the Limitation Act. Under the Mitakshara School of Hindu Law partition may be either (1) a severance of the joint status of the coparcenary by mere defining of shares but without specific allotments or (2) partition by allotment of specific properties by metes and bounds according to shares. The latter, if reduced to writing becomes compulsorily registrable under section I7(1)(b) of the Indian Registration Act but the former does not. Consequently, in the present case such unregistered docu ments as were adduced by the plaintiff for the limited purpose of proving partition in the former sense did not fall within the mischief Of section 49 of the Indian Registration Act and were admissible in evidence. \n",

            "Target: Two employees of the respondent Bank preferred a claim on the basis of the existence of legal light in them to the payment of a customary bonus on the eve of pooja. Their case was that the bonus paid to them every year on the eve of pooja at the rate of pay as on 1st September of the respective year was unrelated to any profit or loss made by the company and that the consecutive payment for more than 16 years without any break of such bonus has developed into a condition of service giving rise to a right and an expectancy which in law assumed the characteristics of customary bonus. The claim was resisted by the bank on the grounds, namely, (a) the application itself was not maintainable since the alleged right pleaded by the workmen was not a condition of service and that such a right did not exist in fact also; (b) the conditions of service of the employees of the Bank are governed by various awards and settlements; (c) though there were agreements entered into between the bank and its employees on several matters there was no agreement at any time on the question of payment of bonus; and (d) though the bonus was paid, as a result of the employees demand every year as per separate agreement for the payment thereof the bonus paid was related to profit and not based on any custom. After considering correspondence that passed between the Bank and its employees, the Labour Court dismissed the application holding that on the basis of the material on record, there was no existing right to customary bonus and that the Labour Court could not either create or declare a right which was not in existence to stretch its jurisdiction under section 330(2) of the . Hence the appeal by special leave. ^ HELD: 1. In the facts and circumstances of the case the bonus received by the appellants did not have the characteristic of customary bonus as known to law and therefore they were not entitled to the quantification of that amount under section 33 c(2) of the , on the basis of tho existence of a legal right in them. In Vegetable Products Ltd. vs Their Workmen, , the Supreme Court has laid down the tests to determine what exactly is customary or festival bonus. The tests laid down are; (I) that the payment has been made over an unbroken series of years; (2) that it has been for a sufficiently long period the period has to be longer than in the case of an implied term of employment; (3) that it has been paid even in years of loss and did not depend on the earning of profits; and (4) that the payment has been at a uniform rate throughout. In the instant case, the record shows that the bonus paid does not satisfy the requirements laid down by the Court. The mere fact the payments were made in the month of September or thereabout every year, by itself will not make the bonus paid a customary pooja bonus. The rate has not been uniform. The management has at all times taken the definite stand that the payment was related to profits and that it was in anticipation of making profit. Further the payments were made at all time pursuant to demands made by the employees. 11061 C F Vegetable Products Ltd vs Their Workmen, applied. The concept of any customary bonus is unknown to nationalised banks. All the nationalised banks are wholly owned undertakings of the Government of India. In the matter of bonus, the employees of the nationalised banks must be dealt with on a common denominator. If therefore, the contention of the appellants were to prevail the employees of the respondent. which is only one amongst many Nationalised banks, would enjoy an undeserved advantage compared to their counterpart in other nationalised banks and even in the other branches of the respondent bank and may become a cause of disharmony and inequality. Therefore, in larger public interest also, the demand for customary bonus otherwise found to be untenable, must be negatived. [1063 C E] \n",

            "Target: In 2006, AIB Group (UK) plc (the Bank) agreed to lend Mr and Mrs Sondhi 3.3m to be secured by a first legal charge over their home, valued at 4.25m. This was on the condition that the existing first legal charge in favour of Barclays Bank plc (Barclays) (borrowings on Barclays accounts amounting to 1.5m) was to be redeemed on or before completion of the Banks mortgage advance. Mark Redler & Co Solicitors (the Solicitors), also acting for Mr and Mrs Sondhi, were instructed on this basis and retained to act on the Banks behalf. Having requested the Bank to forward the funds because completion was imminent, the Solicitors: (i) remitted to Barclays an amount they thought was the total necessary to redeem the Barclays mortgage; and (ii) remitted the balance of the 3.3m less expenses to Mr and Mrs Sondhi. In fact, the Solicitors mistakenly remitted to Barclays an amount which was approximately 300,000 less than was necessary to redeem the Barclays mortgage. As a result, the Bank did not obtain a fully enforceable first charge over the property. When the Bank found out about this, there were negotiations between the Bank and Barclays. As a consequence, the Bank executed a deed of postponement acknowledging the primacy of Barclays charge and Barclays consented to the registration of the Banks charge as a second charge. Subsequently, Mr and Mrs Sondhi defaulted and their property was repossessed and sold by Barclays in February 2011 for 1.2m. The Bank received 867,697, approximately 300,000 less than it should have done if the Solicitors had remitted the correct amount to Barclays. The Bank brought proceedings against the Solicitors claiming, amongst other things, breach of trust. In terms of relief, the Bank argued that it was entitled to recover the full amount of its loan less the 867,697 recovered (approximately 2.5m). HHJ Cooke, at first instance, found that although the Solicitors had acted in breach of trust, the Bank could only recover the amount the Solicitors in fact paid to Mr and Mrs Sondhi but which should have been paid to Barclays (approximately 300,000). The Court of Appeal agreed with HHJ Cookes decision on the relief to which the Bank was entitled. In doing so, it applied what it understood to be the reasoning of Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns [1996] AC 412 (Target Holdings) in relation to equitable principles of compensation. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Toulson finds that the Bank is only entitled to the amount by which it suffered loss (approx. 300,000). Lord Reed writes a separate judgment coming to the same conclusion and with reasons which are substantially the same. Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale and Lord Wilson agree with both Lord Toulson and Lord Reed. Having considered the House of Lords judgment in Target Holdings [21] [36], Lord Toulson finds that it would be a backward step to depart from, or re interpret, Lord Browne Wilkinsons fundamental analysis of the principles of equitable compensation in that case [63]. A monetary award which reflects neither loss caused nor profit gained by the wrongdoer, such as the one argued for by the Bank, would be penal [64]. Moreover, to argue that the Bank has suffered a loss of 2.5m in this case is to adopt an artificial and unrealistic view of the facts [65]. Rather, one must look at the rationale of the monetary remedy for breach of trust; given that the beneficiary of a trust is entitled to have it properly administered, he is entitled to recover losses suffered by reason of the breach of duty [66]. Here, that loss was approximately 300,000 of the Banks loan which it failed to obtain security over. In Target Holdings, Lord Browne Wilkinson stated that, [u]ntil the underlying commercial transaction has been completed, the solicitors can be required to restore the client account monies wrongly paid away [72]. In the current case, although the Solicitors did not complete the transaction in the manner in which it was required, the transaction was, nevertheless, completed as a commercial matter when the loan monies were released to Mr and Mrs Sondhi [74]. The fact that the Solicitors may also have breached the Solicitors Accounts Rules does not affect the analysis [75]. Lord Reed undertakes a broader analysis of the relationship between equitable compensation and common law damages. He considers, first, the Canadian Supreme Court case of Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton & Co (1991) 85 DLR (4th) 129 (Canson Enterprises), focusing mainly on the judgment of McLachlin J [80] [89]. Lord Reed then considers Target Holdings [96] [116]. In that case, Lord Browne Wilkinson did not intend to say that equitable compensation is to be assessed in the same way as common law damages [115]. He was not departing from the orthodox view that where a breach of trust occurs, an equitable obligation arises to restore the trust fund to the position it would have been in but for the breach and that the measure of compensation should be assessed on that basis [116]. A number of common law jurisdictions have subsequently followed the general approach of McLachlin J in Canson Enterprises and Lord Browne Wilkinson in Target Holdings [121] [133]. This is that where trust property has been misapplied, the doctrine of equitable compensation requires the trustee to restore the trust fund, or to pay the beneficiary where the trust has ended, to the position it would have been in if the trustee had performed his obligation [134]. Despite structural similarities when assessing equitable compensation and common law damages, liability of a trustee for breach of trust is not generally the same as liability in damages for tort or breach of contract [136]. The nature of the obligation breached and the relationship between the parties affect the measure of compensation [137]. In the present case, the Banks argument is based on three fallacies: (i) it assumes that the Solicitors misapplied the entire 3.3m as opposed to approximately 300,000 (however, the Court of Appeals decision to the contrary was not challenged before the Supreme Court); (ii) it assumes that the measure of the Solicitors liability was fixed at the date of the breach of trust; and, (iii) it assumes that liability does not depend on a causal link between breach of trust and loss. (ii) and (iii) were rightly rejected in Target Holdings [140]. The Bank should recover its loss, which was approximately 300,000 [141]. \n",
            "Prediction: In June 2006 Mr and Mrs Sondhi applied to borrow 3.3m from the appellant (the bank). The mortgage lender required a fully enforceable first charge over the property by way of legal mortgage, and that all existing charges must be redeemed on or before completion of the mortgage advance. The bank retained the respondents (the solicitors) to act for it by a letter of instruction dated 5 July 2006. The solicitors were instructed in accordance with Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) Handbook for England and Wales, 2nd edition. They failed to keep their word. When eventually they informed the bank there were negotiations between the bank and Barclays with the result that the bank executed a deed of postponement acknowledging the primacy of the Barclays charge and Barclays consented to the registration of the appellant banks charge as a second charge.

            "Target: By Notification No. 94 dated 20th August, 1959 the Governor of West Bengal made Rules under the proviso to Article 309 of the Constitution of India for the regulation of recruitment to the Engineering Services under the Department of Works and Buildings of the State Government. Under these Rules, recruitment to the permanent posts of Assistant Engineers was to be made under Rule 9, while Rule 10 governed recruitment to the temporary posts of Assistant Engineers. Rule 11 provided for emergency appointment by advertisement and interview through the State Public Service Commission, on the basis of a competitive examination conducted by the Service Commission. Accordingly, any appointment to a permanent or temporary post of Assistant Engineer, which was not made in accordance with Rule 9, or 10 or 11 was, therefore, not in accordance with these Service Rules. The respondents in the appeals were petitioners in the writ petitions in the High Court. They were duly appointed Sub Assistant Engineers who were earlier called Overseer Estimators and though Initially diploma holders having obtained the prescribed degree were eligible for appointment as Assistant Engineers. They were appointed temporary Assistant Engineers on ad hoc basis, initially for a period of six months in the PWD 1974 to 1976 and in the Irrigation and Waterways Department 920 between 1972 to 1978. They claimed seniority on the basis of their direct recruitment to the post of Assistant Engineer, and not as promotee from the next below cadre of Sub Assistant Engineers In the promotion quota specified for them in the Rules. Their initial ad hoc appointment was extended periodically upto 26.2.1980, and during this period, several opportunities were given to these persons to appear before the Public Service Commission to satisfy the condition attached to the ad hoc appointment, but none of them complied with the requirement, declining throughout to appear before the Public Service Commission. The State Government requested the Public Service Commission to permit regularisation of the services of these ad hoc appointees as Assistant Engineers, without being selected for regular appointment by the Public Service Commission but the Public Service Commission by several letters turned down that re quest. The Government, finally took the decision on 26th February, 1980 to regularise these persons as Assistant Engineers, and, consequently took three simultaneous steps on 26 2 1980 viz. (1) the requirement in the rules of consultation with the Public Service Commission being dispensed with, (2) absorbtion as temporary Assistant Engineers and (3) a service rule under Article 309 providing for seniority as temporary Assistant Engineers with effect from the same date i.e. 26 2 1980. This statutory rule clearly provided, that all persons appointed regularly in accordance with rules, prior to 26 2 1980, as Assistant Engineers would rank above the ad hoc appointees so absorbed with effect from 26 2 1980 and the Government implemented this decision. The question before the High Court related to the fixation of seniority of these Sub Assistant Engineers appointed ad hoc temporary Assistant Engineers for a specified period in the PWD and the Irrigation and Waterways Department, vis a vis the direct recruits in the cadre of Assistant Engineers appointed regularly according to rules in the department prior to the regularisation of the ad hoc appointees. The writ petitions were dismissed by a Single Judge of the High Court, but the writ appeals were allowed by the Division Bench resulting in grant of the relief claimed by the ad hoc appointees. In the appeals to this Court by the State of West Bengal, and the adversely affected direct recruits who were respondents in the writ petitions filed by the ad hoc appointees, it has been urged that the claim of 921 the respondents for seniority being given to them retrospectively from the date of their initial ad hoc appointment, made contrary to the rules, in spite of their regularisation being made expressly from 26 2 80, is wholly untenable and against the decisions of this Court particularly the Constitution Bench decision on Direct Recruit Class II Engineering Officers ' Association and Ors. vs State of Maharashtra and Ors. ,[1990] 2 SCR 900 = ; , and that the Division Bench of the High Court com mitted an error in reversing the judgment of the Single judge Bench which had dismissed the writ petitions. The appeals were contested by the respondents by submitting that the initial ad hoc appointment of the writ petitioners was made by a mode permissible under the Service Rules, that appointment was made in relaxation of the rules by the Government which is implicit in the action taken, the initial ad hoc appointment must, therefore, be equated to the regular appointment made under the Rules, and on this equation there is no justification for discrimination between the initial ad hoc appointees and regular appointees coming in by direct recruitment thereafter in accordance with the rules. It was further submitted that the case fell squarely within the ambit of conclusion (B) of the summary In Maharashtra Engineers case. Allowing the appeals, this Court, HELD : 1. There is no dispute between promotes and direct recruits, the claim of the writ petitioners being based only as direct recruits in the Cadre of Assistant Engineers, and not as promotees from the lower cadre of Sub Assistant Engineers to which they had earlier belonged. The present is, therefore, not a case of a dispute relating to the surplus promotees, who were given promotion regularly in accordance with rules, but in excess of the quota fixed for them under the rules. In the present case, all the writ petitioners are persons who were given ad hoc temporary appointments for a fixed period, which was extended from time to time till their regularisation on 26 2 1980, and that too by relaxation of the condition of selection by the Public Service Commission, which was an express condition of their ad hoc appointment and a requirement for regular appointment under the Rules. Assuming the relaxation made in their case by the State Government on 26 2 1980 to be valid, they could be treated as regularly appointed only with effect from 26 2 1980 when the 922 relaxation was given to them, and an order was made simultaneously absorbing them in the cadre of Assistant Engineers, also framing a rule at the same time under Article 309 providing for fixation of their seniority only from that date. Accordingly, there is no foundation for the claim that they could be treated at par with the direct recruits, regularly appointed prior to 26 2 1980. [934 C E] 2. Prior to the steps taken by the State Government on 26 2 1980 for regularisation, there was no basis on which the writ petitioners could claim to be regularly appointed as Assistant Engineers; and, therefore, the manner in which they were regularised, including the mode of fixation of their seniority with effect from 26 2 1980, is decisive of the nature of their regular appointment. This alone is sufficient to negative their further claim. They can make no grievance to any part of that exercise, made only for their benefit [934 F G] 3. The claim of the writ petitioners (respondents in all these appeals) for treating their entire period of service prior to 26 2 1980 as regular service for the purpose of seniority, and fixation of their seniority accordingly, is untenable. 1937 A] 4. Rule It of the 1959 Rules provides for appointments to be made during emergency, and lays down that such appointments can be made only by advertisement and interview, through the Public Service Commission. Admittedly, this express requirement in Rule 11 was not followed or fulfilled subsequently, and, therefore, the initial ad hoc appointments cannot be treated to have been made according to the applicable rules. These ad hoc appointments were clearly not in accordance with the rules, and were made only as a stop gap arrangement for fixed period, as expressly stated in the appointment order itself. [937 C] 5. Conclusions (A) and (B) of the Constitution Bench in the Maharashtra Engineer 's case have to be read harmoniously, and conclusion (B) cannot cover cases which are expressly excluded by conclusion (A). It is. clear from conclusion (A) that to enable seniority to be counted from the date of initial appointment and not according to the date of confirmation, the incumbent of the post has to be initially, appointed 'according to the rules '. The corollary set out in conclusion (A), then is, that 'Where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and made as a stop gap arrangement, the officiation in such posts cannot be taken into 923 account for considering the seniority. The case of the writ petitioners squarely falls within this corollary in conclusion (A), which says that the officiation in such posts cannot be taken into account for counting the seniority. [935 D F] 6. Conclusion (B) was added to cover a different kind of situation, wherein the appointments are otherwise regular except for the deficiency of certain procedural requirements laid down by the rules. This is clear from the opening words of the conclusion (B), namely, if the initial appointment is not made by following the procedure laid down by the rules and the later expression 'till the regularisation of his service in accordance with the rules '. Conclusion (B) must be so read as to reconcile with conclusion (A). [936 B] 7. Decision about the nature of the appointment, for determining whether it falls in this category, has to be made on the basis of the terms of the initial appointment itself and the provisions in the rules. In such cases, the deficiency in the procedural requirements laid down by the rules had to be cured at the first available opportunity, without any default of the employee, and the appointee must continue in the post uninterruptedly till the regularisation of his service, in accordance with the rules. In such cases, the appointee is not to blame for the deficiency in the procedural requirements under the rules at the time of his initial appointment. In such cases also, if there be any delay in curing the defects on account of any fault of the appointee, the appointee would not get the full benefit of the earlier period on account of his default, the benefit being confined only to the period for which he is not to blame. This category of cases is different from those covered by the corollary in conclusion (A) which relates to appointment only on ad hoc basis as a stop gap arrangement and not according to rules.

            "Target: The State Government issued a Notification on November 25, 1958 In exercise of power vested under Section 4 of the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948. This Notification exempted 'cotton fabrics of all varieties ' from sales tax. Under it, patta as an item of cotton fabric stood exempted from tax liability. Subsequently, another Notification was issued on December 1, 1973 under Section 3 A of the Act. This Notification pre scribed a rate of tax higher than that provided by Section 3 of the Act which contains the charging provision and pre scribes a uniform rate of tax on sales. Section 3 A empowers the State Government to modify the rate of tax by Notifica tion. This Notification of 1973 was issued without withdraw ing the earlier Notification of 1958. The High Court, affirming the order of the Tribunal, held that in the absence of a Notification withdrawing the earlier Notification of 1958, sales tax would not be exigi ble in terms of the Notification of 1973. Allowing the Appeal, HELD: (Per majority Pathak, CJI and Ranganath Misra, J., Ray, J. dissenting) 1. The High Court was not justified in holding that in the absence of a notification withdrawing the earlier Noti fication of 1958, sales tax would not be exigible in terms of the Notification of 1973. The order of the Tribunal, which has been affirmed by the High Court, is set aside and the assessment restored. [96G] 2. The Notification of 1958 issued under Section 4 of the Act exempted 'cotton fabrics of all varieties ' from sales tax. The Notification of 1973 under Section 3 A of the Act prescribed sales tax of 7% on the sale of beltings of all kinds. There is no dispute that patta is a kind of 94 belting material and, on being treated as cotton fabric, was exempted from sales tax. [95FG] 3. Section 3 is the charging provision; Section 3 A authorises variation of the rate of tax and Section 4 pro vides for exemption from the tax. When after a Notification under Section 4 granting exemption from liability, a subse quent Notification under Section 3 A prescribes the rate of tax, the intention is to withdraw the exemption and make the sale liable to tax at the rate prescribed in the Notifica tion. [96B D] 4. As the power both for the grant of exemption and the variation of the rate of tax vests in the State Government and it is not the requirement of the Statute that a Notifi cation of recall of exemption is a condition precedent to imposing tax at any prescribed rate by a valid Notification under Section 3 A, the second Notification can easily be treated as a combined Notification both for withdrawal of exemption and also for providing higher tax. [96D E] 5. The exemption was in regard to a class of goods and while the exemption continues, a specific item has now been notified under Section 3 A of the Act. [96F] (Per Ray, J. dissenting) 1. Cotton beltings fail within 'beltings of all kinds ' as notified under Section 4 of the Act, being exempt from the imposition of sales tax. As there is a general exemption granted by the Notifications issued in 1957 and 1958 exempt ing 'cotton fabrics of all kinds ', it is not possible to hold, in any view of the matter, that it will be excisable to sales tax on the basis of the Notification dated December 1, 1973 under Section 3 A of the said Act, by the Govern ment. i98F; G H] 2. So long as the general exemption granted under Sec tion 4 with regard to 'cotton fabrics of all kinds ' contin ues, no sales tax can be imposed on beltings of all kinds which fail within the 'cotton fabrics of all kinds ' and the general exemption under Section 4 will prevail over the Notification made under Section 3 A of the Sales Tax Act. [99GH] 3. It is not possible to subscribe to the view that since the Notification under Section 3 A has been made subsequent to the Notification issued under Section 4 of the Act, the subsequent Notification under Section 3 A will prevail over the general exemption granted under Section 4 of the Act.

The Bihar State Road Transport Corporation, a State Undertaking, filed its objections claiming that no private operator could be permitted to operate the said route as part of the route being Ranchi Chaibasa was itself a notified route and grant of permits on the route in question would contravene the notified Scheme. Taking the view that the over lapping Ranchi Chaibasa route was restrictedly notified for direct services only, the objections raised by the Corporation were rejected and permits for the route in question granted to respondents 3 and 4.

Allowing the appeal and quashing all the three orders, this Court. HELD: In the light of the observations made in Constitution 668 Bench decision of this Court in Adarsh Travels ' case defining the word 'route ', the Ranchi Chibasa route is identified as the line of travel on which State Undertaking on nationalisation is allowed to run its vehicles. The bracketed words 'direct service ' occuring in seriol No. 7 when contrasted with entries in serial nos. 1 to 6 reveal that the total route of Ranchi Chaibasa, without leaving any portion, stood nationalised signifying by its name that Ranchi Chaibsa route is a straight and direct line of travel which would be traversed by a vehicle by the State Transport Undertaking between two termini rendering all kinds of services. Any further interpretation would frustrate the object of Chapter IV A whereunder the scheme is prepared. [672G 673B] If the interpretation put by the Patna High Court in Marwari Motor Service 's case to the bracketed words 'direct service ' is to be kept valid, it would frustrate the very purpose of nationalisation, for any person in that event could operate on a nationalised route by adding thereto, or substracting therefrom, some kilometerage and keep one terminus as a point of start, or a point of ending, on an un notified route and put forward his willingness to submit himself to the discipline called 'corridor restictions ' which practice has been deprecated by this Court.

            "Target: The appellant was sentenced to an extended sentence of ten years imprisonment, comprising a custodial term of seven years and an extension period of three years. He was released on licence after serving two thirds of the custodial term, but was recalled to custody after committing a further offence. He then remained in prison until the sentence had been served in full. In these proceedings, he complains that he was not provided with appropriate rehabilitation courses following his recall to prison, contrary to article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention), as given effect in domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998. The principal issue in this appeal is whether the duty under article 5 to provide prisoners with a real opportunity for rehabilitation applies to prisoners serving extended sentences. The lower courts found that there was no violation of article 5. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal, upholding the decision that there was no violation of article 5(1)(a). Lord Reed gives the lead judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees. Previous decisions on Article 5(1)(a) In James v United Kingdom (2013) 56 EHRR 12 (James), the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) applied the general principle that article 5(1) requires the conditions of detention to be consistent with the purpose of the detention. Based on that principle the court concluded that after the punishment part (the tariff period) of an indeterminate sentence for public protection (IPP) has been served and the prisoner remains in detention for reasons of public protection, a real opportunity for rehabilitation should be provided [8 18]. The Supreme Court (UKSC) in R (Kaiyam) v Secretary of State for Justice [2014] UKSC 66 (Kaiyam) accepted there was an obligation to provide life and IPP prisoners with a real opportunity for rehabilitation, but held this was not imposed by article 5(1). Rather, the duty was an ancillary duty in the overall scheme of article 5 and existed throughout the prisoners detention. James was not part of a clear and constant line of decisions. The UKSC was concerned that the approach in James might give prisoners a right to immediate release under the Convention [22 25]. The ECtHR in Kaiyam v United Kingdom (2016) 62 EHRR SE 13 rejected the article 5(1) complaint in Kaiyam as inadmissible on the basis that article 5(1)(a) does not require a real opportunity for rehabilitation during the tariff period, since this represents the punishment part of the sentence. The ECtHR declined to adopt the UKSCs analysis, and adhered to the approach in James. On the facts of Kaiyam, a real opportunity for rehabilitation had been provided to the applicants [32 36]. Whether the UKSC should align its approach with the ECtHR The question of whether the obligation to provide rehabilitation opportunities arises under article 5(1) (as the ECtHR held in James and Kaiyam), or is immanent in article 5 as a whole (as the UKSC held in Kaiyam), affects the substance of the obligation, including: the period during which the obligation applies, the standard of the duty, and the weight to be placed on the Secretary of States assessment of what amounts to a reasonable opportunity [38 41]. In light of this, the UKSCs approach in Kaiyam has resulted in the imposition of a duty on the prison authorities which is significantly different from, and more demanding than, the duty imposed by the Convention. This position is a departure from the usual situation in which the jurisprudence of the UK and the ECtHR aligns. As to the UKSCs concern in Kaiyam, noted above, the ECtHRs approach does not entail an obligation under the Convention to secure the applicants immediate release, as other remedies exist which can remedy the lack of opportunity for rehabilitation [42 43]. Accordingly, the UKSC should now adopt the same approach to the interpretation of article 5(1)(a) as the ECtHR in James, and cease to treat the obligation to provide opportunities for rehabilitation as an ancillary obligation implicit in article 5 as a whole. It is noted, however, that a high threshold has to be surmounted in order to establish a violation of the obligation [44 45]. Application to extended sentences Whereas the previous cases on the duty to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation concerned life or IPP sentences, the present case concerns extended sentences, which may be imposed pursuant to section 210A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. An extended sentence comprises a custodial term and an extension period for which the offender is to be on licence beyond the licence period under the custodial term. A court may impose an extended sentence if it considers the licence period under the custodial term to be insufficient for the protection of the public. When the prisoner subject to the extended sentence is released on licence, the licence remains in force until the end of the extension period. The licence may be revoked if the offender commits a further offence [46 55]. The duty to provide an opportunity for rehabilitation established in James should apply equally to prisoners detained during the extension period of an extended sentence, having regard to the indefinite (albeit not unlimited) duration of detention during the extension period, its purpose of protecting the public from serious harm, and the possibility of change in response to opportunities for rehabilitation. The rationale in James that rehabilitation opportunities had to be available to IPP prisoners where they were detained solely because of the risk they pose to the public, applies to prisoners detained during the extension period of an extended sentence [59 63]. Application to the present case In light of the various opportunities for rehabilitation provided to the appellant in the present case, there can be no doubt that he was provided with a real opportunity for rehabilitation during his custodial sentence and his extended sentence. The appellant was not left in limbo without sentencing planning and without any attempt to provide him with an opportunity to rehabilitate himself. On the contrary, there were courses provided and completed, regular planning meetings, efforts made to find appropriate rehabilitative work, and transfers to less restrictive conditions. The problem which resulted in the appellants serving the whole of his sentence was not the failure of the prison authorities to provide appropriate courses, but his own misconduct. There is no question of his detention during the extension period, or at any other point during his sentence, having been arbitrary [65 85]. \n",

In these proceedings, he complains that he was not provided with appropriate rehabilitation courses following his recall to prison, contrary to article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the Convention), as given effect in our domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998. The principal issue arising in the appeal is whether the duty under article 5 to provide prisoners with a real opportunity for rehabilitation applies to prisoners serving extended sentences. The appeal also provides an opportunity to consider the approach adopted by this court in R (Kaiyam) v Secretary of State for Justice [2014] UKSC 66; [2015] AC 1344\n",

            "Target: The petitioner was detained under section 3(i) and (iii) of the West Bengal (Prevention of Violent Activities) Act, 1970. The first and the second ground of detention served on him mentioned two incidents of theft and throwing of bombs with intent to kill said to have been committed in the yard of Naibati Railway Station. The third and the last ground was that on January 13, 1971 between 12 and 12.20 hrs. the petitioner along with his associates \"being armed with bombs, swords, lathis, etc. entered in a clash with another group with a view to kill them\" and that his \"violent activities created a serious panic in the Station area and disturbed public order. \" The petitioner contended, inter alia that ground No. 3 was vague and uncertain and was couched in such indefinite language that it would be impossible for the petitioner to effectively make a representation and therefore his detention was invalid. In his representation the petitioner had merely denied all the three grounds and maintained that he had no concern with any of the three incidents alleged in the grounds of detention. In his written arguments submitted to this Court the petitioner stated that the allegations in respect of all the grounds were made against him by the Naibati Railway Police and that they were false. In the reply affidavit of the state the averment for the first time made was that the alleged incident in ground No. 3 took place not in Naibati Railway Station area but at another railway station. Allowing the petition, HELD : (1) Ground No. 3 is vague by reason of its omission to mention the locality. It is clear that the petitioner was under the impression, in the absence of the place or the locality where the incident was said to have taken place having been mentioned, that the said incident had taken place either in Naibati Railway Station or the area under the jurisdiction of Naibati police. Therefore, apart from ground No. 3 being vague by reason of its omission to mention the locality, there was in the context of the other two grounds a likelihood of the petitioner being under a wrong impression that according to the District Magistrate the incident there alleged had taken place in the Naibati Railway Station area. That being so, the omission to mention the locality prevented the petitioner from effectively making a representation.

            "Target: For the purpose of acquiring land for an Agricultural College a notification was issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, in January 1959, with respect to several pieces of land one of which belonged to the res pondents and was in possession of the appellant as tenant. After the issue of the notification under section 6, in February 1959, the Commissioner directed that possession of that land may be taken under section 17(1) on the expiry of 15 days from the publication of the notice under section 9(1). On March 24, 1959, the appellant filed a statement before the Land Acquisition Officer. In that statement, he did not deny the publication of notice on the spot under section 9(1) nor did he put any impediment to the taking of the land. He merely wanted the compensation amount to be paid to him and wanted stay of the taking possession of his house on the land. The Land Acquisition Officer passed orders in the presence of the appellant directing the Tahsildar to take possession of the land and hand it over to the Principal of the Agricultural College. The Tahsildar went to the spot, inspected the land for the purpose of determining what part was waste and arable and should therefore be taken possession of and took possession of the land, leaving out the small portion containing the house of the appellant, and handed over possession of the land so taken over to the Principal of the Agricultural College. The appellant was not present at the time when the Tahsildar took possession. There was, thereafter, correspondence between the appellant and the Government. and various reports had been made by the officers of the Government and on April 16, 1959, a stay order was passed by the Government. On December 13, 1961, the Land Acquisition Officer wrote to the Commissioner that possession of the land was still with the appellant, and on August 8, 1968, withdrawal from the acquisition of that part of the land under section 48(1) of the Act, was directed by the Commissioner. The respondents and the Agricultural College filed writ petitions in the High Court, challenging the release of the land. The High Court allowed the petitions holing that possession of the land was taken (even though the Government took the stand that they had taken only 'symbolical ' possession) and given to the Principal of the College and that, therefore, it was not open to the Commissioner to withdraw from the acquisition under section 48(1) as amended by the Land Acquisition (Maharashtra Extension and Amendment) Act. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, HELD : (Per Curiam) : Neither the Government nor the Commissioner could withdraw under section 48(1) from the acquisition of any portion of the land which had been taken over by and vested in the Government. [253 F] (Per P. N. Bhagwati and A. C. Gupta JJ) : When Government proceeds to take possession of the land acquired by it under the Act. it must take actual Possession since all interests in the land are sought to be acquired by it, and there is no question of taking 'symbolical ' possession as understood 251 under the C.P.C. Nor would possession merely on paper be enough. How such actual possession may be taken would depend on the nature of land. It is not an absolute and inviolable rule that merely going on the spot and making a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise would be sufficient to constitute taking possession of land in every case. It is also not strictly necessary as a matter of legal requirement that notice should be given to the owner or occupant of the land that possession would be taken at a particular time, though it may be desirable to do so in order to eliminate the possibility of a fraudulent or collusive transaction of talking of mere paper possession, without the occupant or the owner ever knowing about it. [252E H, 153A B] On the facts and circumstances of the present case, the Tahsildar had taken actual possession of that part of the land which was waste or arable and handed it over to the Principal of the College. The Land Acquisition Officer thought that actual possession could not be regarded as having been taken unless the appellant was excluded from the land, and, since the appellant, without any obstruction entered on the land and continued in possession, he mistakenly stated that actual possession was not taken. The legal position is that even if the appellant entered upon the land after actual possession had been taken by and the land vested in, the Government, the appellant 's possession would not obliterate the consequence of vesting in the Government. [253 B E] [Discussion regarding delivery of 'symbolical ' and 'actual ' possession under the C.P.C. is not necessary for the disposal of the appeals], [252 D] (Per Untwalia J.) : (1) Under the C.P.C., a symbolical or formal delivery of possession has the effect, of dispossessing the judgment debtor from his right, title or interest in the property, although, as a matter of fact, he may have succeeded in resuming possession shortly after dispossession. It does not, however, dispossess the person in actual possession in his own right not liable to be evicted under the decree or in pursuance of the auction sale. [263A B] (2)When a public notice under section 9(1) of the Act is published at a convenient place or near the land to be taken that Government intends to take possession, ordinarily there would be no question of resisting or impeding the taking of possession. Delivery of possession by the owner is not required and the Collector can enforce surrender under section 47 if impeded. On taking possession either under section 16 or section 17(1), the land vests absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances. Therefore, in a proceeding under the Land Acquisition Act for acquisition of land all interests are wiped out, and hence, the taking of possession must be taking actual possession on the spot and not symbolical possession; and surely it cannot be a possession merely on paper. [263E G] (3)As to the mode of taking possession, the Act is silent. Unless possession is taken by the written agreement of the party concerned the mode of taking possession obviously would be for the authority to go upon the land and do some act which would indicate that the authority has taken possession of the land. It may be in the form of a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise or by hanging a written declaration on the spot that possession has been taken. The presence of the owner or the occupant is not necessary to effectuate the taking of possession. [263H, 264A] (4)In the instant case, actual possession of the land was taken by the Tahsildar on the spot and the possession was handed over to the Principal of the College. The Land Acquisition Officer 's statement that the land was not actually taken possession and the Government 's stand that, only symbolical possession was taken, should be viewed from the correct legal position. So viewed, the appellant 's resuming possession after once the land was validly taken by the Government would not have the effect of undoing the fact (if vesting in the Government. [264B, E F] 252 \n",
            "Prediction: The appellant was not present when this was done by the Tehsildar, but the presence of the owner or the occupant of the land was not necessary to effectuate the taking of possession. The appellant immediately, without any obstruction, entered upon the land and continued in possession, and since all interests in the land are sought to be acquired by it, possession merely on paper be enough. In appeal to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the appellants that possession was still with the appellant and it was not actually taken possession of by the Principal, Agricultural College. The Special Land Acquisition Officer in his letter dated 13th December, 1961 to the Commissioner stated that possession of the entire land was stillwith the appellant. The Principal of the Agricultural College gave a declaration by beat of drum or otherwise that possession could not be regarded as having been taken, unless the appellant was excluded from the land. It was also contended by the appellant that possession would be taken at a particular time,\n",

            "Target: Mr. N.L. Patel was posted as Chief Judicial Magistrate at Nadiad in October, 1988. He soon found that the local Police was not cooperating with the courts in efficting service of summons, warrants and notices on accused persons, as a result of which the trials of cases were delayed. He made complaint against the local police to the District Superintendent of Police and forwarded a copy of the same to the Director General of Police but nothing concrete hap pened. On account of these complaints, Mr. S.R. Sharma, Police Inspector, Nadiad was annoyed with the Chief Judicial Magistrate and he withdrew constables posted in the CJM Court. In April 1989, the CJM filed two complaints with the Police against the Police Inspector and other Police Offi cials, Nadiad for delaying the process of the Court. On 25th July, 1989, the CJM directed the police to register a crimi nal case against 14 persons who had caused obstruction in judicial proceedings but subsequently since unqualified apology was tendered, the CJM directed the Police Inspector to drop the cases. The Police Inspector reacted strongly to the CJM 's direction and he made complaint against the CJM to the Registrar of the High Court through the District Super intendent of Police. On account of the aforesaid facts there was hostility between the Police of Nadiad and the CJM. 939 On 25th September 1989, the Police Inspector met the CJM in his chambers to discuss a case where the Police had failed to submit the charge sheet within 90 days. During discussion the Police Inspector invited the CJM to visit the police station to see the papers and assured him that he would mollify the sentiments of the police officials. At 8.35 p.m. on the said date, the Police Inspector sent a Police Jeep to the CJM 's residence and he went to the Police Station. According to the CJM when he arrived in the Police Station he was forced to consume liquor and on his refusal he was assulted, handcuffed and tied with rope by Police Inspector, Sub Inspector, Head Constable, and Constable and that he was sent to Hospital for Medical Examination under handcuffs. A photographer was arranged to take his photo graph which was published in the newspapers. The Police Inspector disputed these allegations and according to him the CJM entered his chamber at the Police Station in a drunken state, shouting and abusing him and since he was violent, he was arrested, handcuffed and sent to Hospital for Medical Examination. He himself wanted to be photo graphed and that is why the photographs were taken by the press photographer. As the incident undermined the dignity of courts in the country, Judicial Officers, Judges and Magistrates all over the country were in a state of shock, they felt insecure and humiliated. A number of Bar Associations passed Resolutions and went on strike. The Delhi Judicial Service Association, the All India Judges Association, Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh and many others approached this Court by means of telegrams and petitions under Article 32 for saving the dignity and honour of the judiciary. The CJM also filed an application for quashing the two FIRs lodged against him and for directing the trial of his complaint as State case an award of compensation. On 29.9.1989 this Court took cogni zance of the matter by issuing notices to the State of Gujarat and other Police Officers. Since there was serious dispute between the parties with regard to the entire incident, the Court appointed the senior puisne Judge of the Allahabad High Court to inquire into the incident and to submit a report to the Court. The inquiry was held on behalf of the Court and not under the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act. A detailed report was submitted to this Court and the Court directed copies to be delivered to the concerned parties and permit ted the parties and the contemners to file their objections before this Court. 940 The Learned Commissioner 's Report establised the follow ing facts and circumstances: that the CJM found that the Police of Nadiad was not effective in service of summons and had adopted an attitude of indifference to the court 's orders, and as complaints were forwarded to the authorities by the CJM there was confrontation between the local police and the magistracy. When the CJM visited the police station pursuant to the Police Inspector 's request to discuss the matter, he was forced to consume liquor and on his refusal he was assaulted. He was tied up with a rope by the Police personnel and handcuffed deliberately in defiance of the state 's Police Regulations and Circulars and the decision of this Court in Prem Shankar Shukla vs Delhi Administration. , A panchnama showing the drunken state of the CJM was pre pared by the Police Inspector and signed by two panchas a Mamlatdar and a Fire Brigade Officer. A press photographer was brought on the scene, the police personnel posed with the CJM for the press photographer and the same was pub lished in newspapers. A request made by the CJM to the Civil Hospital doctors to contact and inform the District Judge about the incident was not allowed. On examination at the hospital, the body of the CJM was found to have a number of injuries. His blood was taken and chemical examination conducted. The Chemical Examiner submitted a report holding that the blood sample contained alcohol. At the initial stage only one case was registered against the CJM by the Police under the Bombay Prohibition Act, but when lawyers met the Police Inspector for securing release of the CJM on bail, the offence being bailable, the Police Inspector, registered another case under Sections 332 and 506 IPC in order to frustrate the attempt. The District Superintendent of Police did not take immediate action in the matter but created an alibi that he had gone elsewhere and stayed in the government Rest House there, the register of the Rest House however indicating that the entry regarding the stay was manipulated subsequently by making an interpolation. On behalf of the contemners Police Officers it was contended that: (1) this Court had no jurisdiction or power to indict the Police Officers even if they are found to be guilty, as their conduct does not amount to contempt of this Court. Articles 129 and 215 demarcate the respective areas of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts respectively, and this Court 's jurisdiction under Article 129 is confined to the contempt of itself only, and it has no jurisdiction to indict a person for contempt of an infe rior court subordinate to the. High Court. (2) Even if the Supreme Court is a court of record, it has no power to take action for the contempt of a Chief Judicial Magistrate 's court as neither the constitution nor any statutory provi sion confer any 941 such jurisdiction or power on this Court. So far as the High Court is concerned, it has power of judicial and administra tive superintendence over the subordinate courts and Section 15 of the Contempts of Courts Act, 1971 expressly confers power on the High Court to take action for the contempt of subordinate courts. (3) Under Entry 77 of List I of the Seventh Schedule, Parliament has legislative competence to make a law curtailing the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and Section 15 of the Contempts of Courts Act 1971 curtails the inherent power of this Court with regard to contempt of subordinate courts. Inherent powers are always preserved but they do not authorise a court to invest itself with juris diction when that jurisdiction is not conferred by law. (4) Assumption of contempt jurisdiction with regard to contempt of subordinate and inferior courts on the interpretation of Article 129 of the Constitution is foreclosed by the deci sions of the Federal Court in K.L. Gauba vs The Honable the Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court o] ' judicature at Lahore & Anr., AIR 1942 FC 1. This Court being the successor to the Federal Court was bound by the decisions of the Federal Court under Article 374(2) of the Constitution. (5) In our country there is no court of universal jurisdiction, as the jurisdiction of all courts including the Supreme Court is limited. (6) Article 142(1) does not contemplate any order contrary to statutory provisions. (7) The findings recorded by the Commission cannot be taken into account as those findings are hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution. The Attorney General urged that the power to punish contempt is a special jurisdiction which is inherent in a Court of record, that a superior court of record has inher ent power to punish for contempt of itself and it necessari ly includes and carries with it the power to punish for contempt committed in respect of subordinate or inferior courts, that a superior court of record having power to correct the order of an inferior court has power to protect that court by punishing those who interfere with the due administration of justice of that court. It was further urged that the recognises and preserves the existing contempt jurisdiction and power of the court of record for punishing for contempt of subordi nate or inferior courts, that the Act has not affected or restricted the suo motu inherent power of the Supreme Court being a court of record which has received constitutional sanction under Article 129, that since this Court has taken cognizance of the contempt matter arising out of the inci dent which is the subject matter of trial before the crimi nal court, this Court has ample power under Article 142 of the Constitution to pass any order necessary to do justice and prevent abuse of process of the court and that there is no limitation on the power of this Court under Article 142 942 in quashing a criminal proceeding pending before a subordi nate court. The basic questions that arose for consideration of the Court were: (a) whether the Supreme Court has inherent jurisdiction or power to punish for contempt of subordinate or inferior courts under Article 129 of the Constitution, (b) whether the inherent jurisdiction and power of the Supreme Court is restricted by the , (c) whether the incident interfered with the due administration of justice and constituted contempt of court, and (d) what punishment should be awarded to the contemners found guilty of contempt. Disposing of the writ petitions, Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions, and contempt petitions, this Court. HELD: 1.1 Contempt of court is an act or commission calculated to interfere with the due administration of justice. It includes civil and criminal contempt. [991D] Bowen L.J. in Helmore vs Smith, at 455, referred to. 1.2 The definition of criminal contempt is wide enough to include any act by a person which would tend to interfere with the administration of justice or which would lower the authority of court. The public have a vital stake in effec tive and orderly administration of justice. The Court has the duty of protecting the interest of the community in the due administration of justice and, so, it is entrusted with the power to commit for contempt of court, not to protect the dignity of the Court against insult or injury, but, to protect and vindicate the right of the public so that the administration of justice is not perverted, prejudiced, obstructed or interfered with Offutt vs U.S.; , , referred to. [991F] 1.3 The power to punish contempt is vested in the Judges not for their personal protecting only, but for the protec tion of public justice, whose interest, requires that decen cy and decorum is preserved in Courts of Justice. Those who have to discharge duty in a Court of Justice are protected by the law, and shielded in the discharge of their duties. Any deliberate interference with the discharge of such duties either in court or outside the court by attacking the presiding officers of the court, would amount to criminal contempt and the courts must take serious cognizance of such conduct. [993B] 943 The object and purpose of punishing contempt for interference with the administration of justice is not to safeguard or protect the dignity of the Judge or the Magis trate, but the purpose is to preserve the authority of the courts to ensure an ordered life in society. [991H] Attorney General vs Times Newspapers, (1974] A.C. 273 at p. 302, referred to. 1.5 The Chief Judicial Magistrate is head of the Magis tracy in the District who administers justice to ensure, protect and safaguard the rights of citizens. The subordi nate courts at the district level cater to the need of the masses in administering justice at the base level. By and large the majority of the people get their disputes adjudi cated in subordinate courts. It is, in the general interest of the community that the authority of subordinate courts is protected. If the CJM is led into a trap by unscrupulous Police Officers, and if he is assaulted, handcuffed and roped, the public is bound to lose faith in Courts, which would be destructive of the basic structure of an ordered society. If this is permitted Rule of Law shall be supplant ed by Police Raj. [992D E] 1.6 The conduct of Police Officers in the instant case, in assaulting and humiliating the CJM brought the authority and administration of justice into disrespect, affecting the public confidence in the institution of justice. [992G] 1.7 The incident is a clear interference with the admin istration of justice, lowering its judicial authority. Its effect was not confined to one District or State, it had a tendency to affect the entire judiciary in the country. The incident high lights a dangerous trend that if the Police is annoyed with the orders of a presiding officer of a court, he would be arrested on flimsy manufactured charges, to humiliate him publicly as has been done in the instant case. [992F] 1.8 The facts of the instant case, demonstrate that a presiding officer of a court may be arrested and humiliated on flimsy and manufactured charges which could affect the administration of justice. In order to avoid any such situa tion in future, it is necessary to lay down guidelines which should be followed in the case of arrest and detention of a Judicial Officer. [1000F] 1.9 In view of ' the paramount necessity of preserving the independence of judiciary and at the same time ensuring that infractions of law are ' properly investigated the following guidelines are to be 944 followed: (a) If a judicial officer is to be arrested for some offence, it should be done under intimation to the District Judge or the High Court as the case may be. (b) If facts and circumstances necessitate the immediate arrest of a judicial officer of the subordinate judiciary, a technical or formal arrest may be effected. (c) The fact of such arrest should be immediately communicated.to the District and Sessions Judge of the concerned District and the Chief Justice of the High Court. (d) The Judicial Officer so arrested shall not be taken to a police station, without the prior order or directions of the District & Sessions Judge of the concerned District, if available. (e) Immediate facilities shall be provided to the Judicial Officer for communication with his family members, legal advisors and Judicial Officers, including the District & Sessions Judge. (f) No statement of a Judicial Officer who is under arrest be recorded nor any panchnama be drawn up nor any medical test be conducted except in the presence of the Legal Advi sor of the Judicial Officer concerned or another Judicial Officer of equal or higher rank, if available. (g) There should be no handcuffing of a Judicial Officer. If, however, violent resistance to arrest is offered or there is imminent need to effect physical arrest in order to avert danger to life and limb, the person resisting arrest may be over powered and handcuffed. In such case, immediate report shall be made to the District & Sessions Judge concerned and also to the Chief Justice of the High Court. But the burden would be on the Police to establish the necessity for effecting physical arrest and handcuffing the Judicial Officer and if it be established that the physical arrest and hand cuffing of the Judicial Officer was unjustified, the Police Officers causing or responsible for such arrest and handcuffing would be guilty of misconduct and would also be personally liable for compensation and/or damages as may be summarily deter mined by the High Court. [1000G 1001F] 1.10 These guidelines are not exhaustive but are the minimum safeguards to be observed in case of arrest of a Judicial Officer. These should be implemented by the State Governments as well as by the High Courts. [1001G] 1. 11 No judicial officer should visit a Police Sta tion on his own except in connection with his official and judicial duties and functions, and this also with prior intimation to the District and Sessions Judge. [1002B] 2.1 The Supreme Court as the Apex Court is the protec tor and guardian of justice throughout the land, therefore, it has a right and also a duty to protect the courts whose orders and judgments are amenable to correction, from com mission of contempt against them. This 945 right and duty of the Apex Court is not abrogated merely because the High Court also has this right and duty of protection of the subordinate courts. The jurisdictions are concurrent and not exclusive or antagonistic. [967G H] 2.2 Article 136 vests the Supreme Court with wide powers to grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree determination sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India except a court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces. The Court 's appellate power under Article 136 is plenary, it may entertain any appeal by granting special leave against any order made by any Magistrate, Tribunal or any other subordinate court. The width and amplitude of the power is not affected by the practice and prcedure followed in insisting that before invoking the jurisdiction under Article 136 the aggrieved party must exhaust remedy available under the law before the appellate authority of the High Court. Self imposed restric tions do not divest it of its wide powers to entertain any appeal against any order or judgment passed by any court or tribunal in the country without exhausting alternative remedy before the appellate authority or the High Court. The power of the Court under Article 136 is unaffected by Arti cles 132. 133 and 134(A) in view of the expression \"notwith standing anything in this Chapter\" occurring in Article 136. [968E 969A] Durga Shankar Mehta vs Thakur Raghuraj Singh & Ors., [1955] 1 SCR 267 and Arunachalam vs P.S.R. Sadhananthm & Anr., ; , referred to. 2.3 In addition to the appellate power, the Supreme Court has special residuary power to entertain appeal against any order of any court in the country. The plenary jurisdiction of the Court to grant leave and hear appeals against any order of a court or Tribunal, confers power of judicial superintendence over all the courts and Tribunals in the territory of India including subordinate courts of Magistrate and District Judge. The Court has, therefore, supervisory jurisdiction over all courts in India. [970F] 2.4 Article 129 provides that the Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself. Article 215 contains similar provision in respect of High Court. Both the Supreme Court as well as High Courts are courts of record having powers to punish for contempt in cluding the power to punish for contempt of itself. [970G] 946 2.5 The Constitution does not define \"Court Of Record\". A \"Court of Record\" is a court where acts and judicial proceedings are enrolled in parchment for a perpetual memo rial and testimony, which rolls are called the 'record ' of the court and.are conclusive evidence of that which is recorded therein. [970H 971 E] ' Wharton 's Law Lexicon: Words & Phrases (Permanent Edi tion) vol. 10 p. 429: Halsbury 's Laws of England Vol. 10 p. 319. 2.6 In India prior to the enactment of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926, High Court 's jurisdiction in respect of contempt of subordinate and inferior courts was regulated by the principles of Common Law of England. The High Courts in the absence of statutory provision exercised power of con tempt to protect the subordinate courts on the premise of inherent power of a Court of Record.

The Supreme Court being a Court of Record under Article 129 and having wide power of judicial supervision over all the courts in the country, must possess and exercise similar jurisdiction and power as the High Courts had prior to Contempt Legislation in 1926. Inherent powers of a superior Court of Record have remained unaffected even after Codifi cation of Contempt Law. [976G 977A] Sukhdev Singh Sodhi vs The Chief Justice and Judges of the PEPSU High Court, ; and R.L. Kapur vs State of Tamil Nadu, ; , referred to. 947 2.8 The was enacted to define and limit the powers of Courts in punishing contempts of courts and to regulate their procedure in relation there to. There is no provision therein curtailing the Supreme Court 's power with regard to contempt of subordinate courts, Section 15 expressly refers to this Court 's power for taking action for contempt of subordinate courts. The section prescribes modes for taking cognizance of criminal contempt by the High Court and Supreme Court. It is not a substantive provision conferring power or jurisdiction on the High Court or on the Supreme Court for taking action for the contempt of its subordinate courts. The whole object of prescribing procedural modes of taking cognizance in Section 15 is to safeguard to valuable time of the High Court and the Supreme Court being wasted by frivolous complaints of contempt of court. Section 15(2) does not restrict the power of the High Court to the cognizance of the contempt of itself or of a subordinate court on its own motion although apparently the Section does not say so. [977A C, 978G 979A] S.K. Sarkar, Member, Board of Revenue, U.P. Lucknow vs Vinay Chandra Misra; , , referred to. 3.1 Under Entry 77 of List I of the Seventh Schedule read with Article 246, Parliament is competent to enact a law relating to the powers of the Supreme Court with regard to 'contempt of itself '. Such a law may prescribe procedure to be followed and it may also prescribe the maximum punish ment which could be awarded and it may provide for appeal and for other matters. But the Central Legislature has no legislative competence to abridge or extinguish the juris diction or power conferred on the Supreme Court under Arti cle 129. The Parliament 's power to legislate in relation to the law of contempt relating to the Supreme Court is limit ed, therefore the does not impinge upon the Supreme Court 's power with regard to the contempt of subordinate courts under Article 129. [979C F] 3.2 Article 129 declares the Supreme Court a court of record and it further provides that the Supreme Court shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself The expression used in Article 129 is not restrictive, instead it is extensive in nature. If the Framers of the Constitution intended that the Supreme Court shall have power to punish for contempt of itself only, there was no necessity for inserting the expression \"including the power to punish for contempt of itself. \" [979G] 3.3 Article 129 confers power on the Supreme Court to punish for 948 contempt of itself and in addition, it confers some addi tional power relating to contempt as would appear from the expression \"including\". The expression \"including\" has been interpreted by courts, to extend and widen the scope of power. The plain language of the Article clearly indicates that the Supreme Court as a Court of record has power to punish for contempt of itself and also something else which could fall within the inherent jurisdiction of a court of record. [979H 980A] 3.4 In interpreting the Constitution, it is not permis sible to adopt a construction which would render any expres sion superfluous or redundant. [980B] 3.5 While construing Article 129, it is not permissible to ignore the significance and impact of the inclusive power conferred on the Supreme Court. [980B] 3.6 The conferment of appellate power on the Court by a statute section 19 of the does not and cannot affect the width and amplitude of inherent powers of this Court under Article 129 of the Constitution. [981E] K.L. Gauba vs The Honable the Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court of Judicature at Lahore & Anr AIR 1942 FC 1, distinguished. 4.1 Article 374(2) is in the nature of a transitory provision to meet the exigency of the situation on the abolition of the Federal Court and setting up of the Supreme Court. There is no provision in the said Article to the effect that the decisions of the Federal Court shall be binding on the Supreme Court. The decisions of the Federal Court and the Privy Council made before the commencement of the Constitution are entitled to great respect but these decisions are not binding on the Supreme Court and it is always open to this Court to take a different view. [983F G] Om Prakash Gupta vs The United Provinces, AIR 1951 Allahabad 205 and State of Bombay vs Gajanan Mahadev Badley, AIR 1954 Bombay 352, approved. The State of Bihar vs Abdul Majid, ; and Shrinivas Krishnarao Kango vs Narayan Devji Kango & Ors., ; , referred to. 949 K.L. Gauba vs The Hon 'ble the Chief Justice and Judges or the High Court of Judicature at Lahore & Anr., AIR 1942 FC 1 and Purshottam Lal Jaitly vs The King Emperor, , explained and distinguished. The Federal Court exercised limited jurisdiction as conferred on it by the Government of India Act 1935. The question regarding the inherent power of the Supreme Court as a Court of Record in respect of the contempt of subordi nate Courts was neither raised nor discussed in its deci sions. The Federal Court observed that if the High Court and the Federal Court both have concurrent jurisdiction in contempt matters, it could lead to conflicting judgments and anamolous consequences. That may be so under the Government of India Act as the High Court and the Federal Court did not have concurrent jurisdiction, but under the Constitution, High Court and the Supreme Court both have concurrent juris diction in several matters, yet no anamolous consequences follow. [985H 986B] 4.2 The Federal Court did not possess the wide powers as the Supreme Court has under the Constitution. There are marked difference in the constitution and jurisdiction and the amplitude of powers exercised by the two courts. In addition to civil and criminal appellate jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has wide powers under Article 136 over all the courts and Tribunals in the country. The Federal Court had no such power, instead it had appellate power but that too could be exercised only on a certificate issued by the High Court. The Federal Court was a court of record under Section 203 but it did not possess any plenary or residuary appel late power over all the courts functioning in the territory of India like the power conferred on the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution. Therefore, the Federal Court had no judicial control or superintendence over subor dinate courts. [986C E] 4.3 Advent of freedom, and promulgation of the Constitu tion have made drastic changes in the administration of justice necessitating new judicial approach. The Constitu tion has assigned a new role to the Constitutional Courts to ensure rule of law in the country. These changes have brought new perceptions. In interpreting the Constitution, regard must be had to the social, economic and political changes, need of the community and the independence of the judiciary. The Court cannot be a helpless spectator, bound by precedents of colonial days which have lost relevance. Time has come to have a fresh look to tile old precedents and to lay down law with the changed perceptions keeping in view the provisions of the Constitution. [986F G] 950 5.1 Courts constituted under a law enacted by the Par liament or the State Legislature have limited jurisdiction and they cannot assume jurisdiction in a matter, not ex pressly assigned to them, but that is not so, in the case of a superior court of record constituted by the Constitution such a court does not have a limited jurisdiction, instead it has power to determine its own jurisdiction. No matter is beyond the jurisdiction of a superior court of record unless it is expressly shown to be so, under the provisions of the Constitution. In the absence of any express provision in the Constitution, the Apex Court being a Court of record has jurisdiction in every matter and if there be any doubt, the Court has power to determine its jurisdiction. If such determination is made by the High Court, the same would be subject to appeal to this Court, but if the jurisdiction is determined by this Court it would be final. [988C E] Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar & Ors. vs State of Maharashtra ; and Ganga Bishan vs Jai Narain, , referred to. 5.2 Since the Supreme Court has power of judicial super intendence and control over all the courts and Tribunals functioning in the entire territory of the country, it has a corresponding duty to protect and safeguard the interest of inferior courts to ensure the flow of the stream of justice in the courts without any interference or attack from any quarter. The subordinate and inferior courts do not have adequate power under the law to protect themselves, there fore, it is necessary that this Court should protect them. Under the constitutional scheme it has a special role in the administration of justice and the powers conferred on it under Article 32, 136, 141 and 142 form part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The amplitude of the power of the court under these Articles of the Constitution cannot be curtailed by law made by Central or State Legislature. [987A C] 5.3 The Supreme Court and the High Court both exercise concurrent jurisdiction under the constitutional scheme in matters relating to fundamental rights under Articles 32 and 226 of the Constitution. Therefore, this Court 's jurisdic tion and power to take action for contempt of subordinate courts would not be inconsistent to any constitutional scheme. [987D] 5.4 The Apex Court is duty bound to take effective steps within the constitutional provisions to ensure a free and fair administration of justice through out the country. For that purpose it must wield the 951 requisite power to take action for contempt of subordinate courts. Ordinarily, the High Court would protect the subor dinate courts from any onslaught on their independence, but in exceptional cases, extraordinary situation may prevail affecting the administration of public justice or where the entire judiciary is affected, this Court may directly take cognizance of contempt of subordinate courts. [987F] 5.5 The Supreme Court will sparingly exercise its inher ent power in taking cognizance of the contempt of subordi nate courts, as ordinarily matters relating to contempt of subordinate courts must be dealt with by the High Courts. The instant case is of exceptional nature as the incident created a situation where functioning of the subordinate courts all over the country was adversely affected and the administration of justice was paralysed, therefore, this Court took cognizance of the matter. [987G 988A] 6.1 Though there is no provision like section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code conferring express power on the Supreme Court to quash or set aside any criminal proceeding pending before a criminal court \n",
            "Prediction: On 25th September, 1989, a horrendus incident took place in the town of Nadiad, District Kheda in the State of Gujarat, which exhibited the berserk behaviour of Police undermining the dignity and independence of judi ciary. A number of Bar Associations, Judges and Magistrates all over the country were in a state of shock, they felt insecure and humiliated and it appeared that instead of Rule of Law there was Police Raj in Gujarat. The Delhi Judicial Service Association, All India Judges Association, Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh, Judicial Service of Gujarat and many others approached the Apex Court by means of telegrams and petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for Saving the dignity, honour of the judiciary. On 29.9.1989, this Court took cognizance of the matter by issuing notices to the State and other Police Officers.

            "Prediction: The appellant company in these appeals filed five applications before the Assistant Collector under section 27 (1) of the Customs referred to as the Act, for refund of the excess amount of duty charged. The appellant took the stand that if a custom duty would have been charged on V. P. Latex under the residuary item 87 of the Indin Tariff Act, 1934 instead of ICT 39 an item meant for charging duty on raw rubber, the amount would not have been less to the extent of Rs. 3,74,879.49 on the five consignments in question.

            "Target: Under the Standing Orders of the appellant company, its employees were entitled to five holidays with pay on specified dates during each year. Furthermore, by an agreement with the respondents ' union, the company had agreed to grant an additional day 's holiday with pay, thus raising the total number of paid annual holidays to six. In 1958 the Kerala Industrial Establishments (National and Festival Holidays) Act, 1958, was passed and section 3 of the Act required every employer to declare holidays on every 26th January, 15th August and 1st May, and to grant four additional festival holidays each year, on dates to be fixed by the Inspector after consulting the employer and the employees. The number of paid holidays was thus statutorily fixed at 7. In 1962, the company obtained the Inspector 's decision on the four festival holidays and declared the dates on which such holidays would be given. At that time, while an industrial dispute between the company and its employees was pending. the respondents filed applications under section 33A of the , before the Tribunal. It was contended in these applications that the statutory provision in section 3 for 7 paid holidays did not override or abrogate the existing arrangement as to paid holidays and that the holidays to be given under section 3 would be in addition, to the holidays which the appellant was bound to give the respondents under existing arrangements; and that the appellant 's attempt to limit the nUmber of paid holidays to 7 during 1962 was contrary to the terms of employment evidenced by the existing arrangement and therefore violative of section 33. This contention was upheld by the Tribunal. In appeal to this Court, HELD: Under section 3 the statutory requirement is 7 paid holidays each year. If under an existing arrangement the employees were entitled to more than 7 paid holidays, such more favourable right was protected by section 11. The scheme of section 11 clearly shows that section 3 is not intended to prescribe a minimum number of paid holidays in addition to the existing ones and, in the present case, would operate only to raise the total number of holidays from 6 under the existing arrangements to 7 paid holidays in accordance with section 3.

            "Prediction: The appellant, the Tam Oil Mills Company Ltd., filed two complaints under section 33A of the Kerala Industrial Establishments (National and Festival Holidays) Act, 1958. These applications alleged that the management of the appellant had contravened the provisions of section 33 of the said Act inasmuch as it had denied its employees leave with wages on Founder's Day and Good Friday in 1962. The appellant contended that the Tribunal should direct the appellant to give its employees holidays under the said existing arrangement and should pass other appropriate order's for the payment of wages for the two holidays in question. The Tribunal rejected the appellant's plea and has declared that the respondents are entitled to the privilege 'of paid holidays on the said two days under the terms and cOnditions of service, and that even after this agreement was reached, the respondents began to claim additional holidays; but the appellant was not prepared to make any addition to the list of holidays.

            "Target: Under the Chanda Patent and the terms recorded in the Wajibul Arz the Dhanora Zamindari was impartible and on the death of the holder it devolved upon his eldest son and in the absence of a legitimate or an adopted son it devolved upon the nearest male relative. The succession to the Zamindari was subject to the power of the Governor to dispossess a person found unfit to observe the conditions of loyalty, good police administration and improvement of the estate. The respondent instituted an action for possession of certain immovable properties including the zamandari and for recovery of compensation, in respect of malguzari lands, paid to the appellants in consequence of the enactment of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estate, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1951. They claimed the Zamindari relying upon the rule of primogeniture and other estates as devisees under a Will. The trial court decreed the suit and the High Court affirmed the decree with slight modifications. in the appeal to this Court the appellants urged that (1) the Zamindari devolved on the death of the holder on the male relative who is senior most in age and not the eldest member in the senior line; (2) by the order of the Governor the Zamindari was conferred upon the first appellant as he was found suitable to hold the zamindari and since the Government had the power to determine inheritance and the right to remove a person, the holder of the zamindari had merely a life interest; and (3) the compensation officer had decided by his order under section 14 of the Act that compensation in respect of malqutari land was payable to the first appellant and since no suit was filed by the plaintiffs for setting aside that decision within the period specified, the order of the compensation officer became final and conclusive. HELD : (1) By the use of the expression \"the nearest male relative\" the test of propinquity alone may be applied and when there are two or more claimants equally removed from the common ancestor the eldest male member in the senior most line will be preferred. The contest between the parties had to be adjudged in the light of the rules of lineal primogeniture governing an impartible estate. In determining a single their according to the rules of primogeniture the class of heirs who would 325 be entitled to succeed the property if it were partible must be ascertained first, and then the single heir applying the special rule must be selected. By the expression \"nearest male relative\" it was not intended to confer be estate upon the eldest male relative of the Zamindar. The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the Zamindari devolved upon the first respondent to ' the exclusion of the first appellant. [333 C F] (2) The power vested in the Governor to take extraordinary steps to protect the interest of the zamindari by the removal of the holder did not restrict the title of the zamindar to a mere life interest. The power had to be exercised in accordance with the custom of the family and an order by the Governor purporting to exercise powers under the Chanda Patent contemplated a quasi judicial inquiry. The order does not show that any inquiry was made for determining the rights of the contesting claimants. [334 G] (3) Section 14 of Act 1 of 1951 does not invest the compensation officer with jurisdiction to determine competing claims of persons claiming proprietary rights to the property vested in the Government by the operation of section 3 of the Act. Section 14 is intended to determine only the proprietary rights in the land qua the State. [339 D E] \n",
            "Prediction: The appellants contended that the Zamindari of Dhanora was granted to Sitaram ancestor of Amarshah as an impartible estate, devolving by the rule of primogeniture. They contended that by the order of the Governor of Madhya Pradesh dated November 9, 1951, the Zindari on that account devolved upon them under a will executed on December 3, 1950 whereby Amarshahs devised his estate in their favour. The appellants also claimed that the other property in suit originally belonged to Gangashah, and that the branches of Sakru and Kajur became extinct a long time ago.

            "Target: The first respondent was carrying on business of selling country liquor. In exercise of the powers conferred by section 29(2) of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act, 1915, the appellant issued an Order and in pursuance of that Order a date was notified for selling by public auction the exclusive privilege. of selling by retail, country liquor in 8 shops. The respondent was the highest bidder but his bid was rejected because the Government was of the view that inadequate prices had been offered as a result of collusion between the bidders. Thereafter, tenders were called for and the appellant accepted the tender in respect of one shop and rejected the others as it was again of the opinion that the price offered was inadequate. Thereafter, the remaining 7 shops were ' sold by private negotiation for substantially higher prices. A writ petition filed by the respondent in the High Court was allowed mainly on the ground that the power centered on the Government by cl. (vi) of the Order, that no sale shall be deemed to be final unless confirmed by the State who shall be at liberty to accept or reject without assigning any reason, was an unguided power violative of articles 14 and 19(1) (g). Allowing the appeal to this Court, HELD : (1) Section 22 of the Act confers power on the Government to grant to any person on such conditions and for such period as it may think fit the exclusive privilege of selling in retail country liquor; and section 29 empowers the Government to accept payment in consideration of the grant either by calling tenders or by auction or otherwise as it may by general order direct. The powers conferred on the State Government by sections 22 and 29 are absolute. The Government cannot be said to have conferred on itself arbitrary power under cl. (vi) of its Order, passed under section 29(2), because, the power that the Government reserved for itself under that clause is nothing more than what was conferred on it by the Legislature under the sections. Since the validity of the sections was not challenged the validity of the Order could not also be challenged. [792 B F] (2) Even otherwise, one of the important purposes of selling the exclusive right to sell liquor in wholesale or retail is to raise revenue; and excise 'revenue forms an important part of every State 's revenue. The Government is a guardian of the finances of the State and is expected to protect its financial interests. The fact that the prices fetched by the sale of the privilege to sell country liquor is an excise revenue does not change the nature of the right in the Government. Therefore, the 785 Legislature has empowered the Government to see that there is no leakage in the revenue. It was for the Government to decide whether the price offered in an auction is adequate and the conclusion reached by the Government does not affect anyone 's rights. [793 D F; 794 F G] (3) Public auctions are held to get the best possible price and there is no completed contract till the bid is accepted. There is, therefore, no basis for, contending that the owner of the privileges who had offered to sell them cannot decline to accept the highest bid if he thinks that the price offered is inadequate, and, it makes no difference that the Government was the seller. [793 G H; 794 A] (4) If the Government is exclusive owner of the privileges, the respondent could not rely on article 14 and 19(1)(g), because, citizens cannot have any fundamental right to trade or carry on business in the properties or rights belonging to Government, nor can there be any infringement of article 14 if Government tries to get the best available price for its valuable, rights. Further there is no inherent right in a citizen to sell intoxicating liquor by retail. [793 A; 794 A B] Coverjee B. Bharucha vs The Excise Commissioner and the Chief Commissioner, Ajmer and Ors., ' ; and Union of India and Ors. vs M/s. Bhimsen Walait Ram, ; , followed. (5) Assuming that the question of arbitrary or unguided power can be raised it should be remembered that the power to accept or reject the highest bid is given to the highest authority in the State, namely, the Government, which is expected to safeguard the finances of the State and it is not a case of delegated power but of power conferred by the Legislature. While accepting or rejecting a bid Government is performing an executive function and the correctness of its conclusion is not open to Judicial review where the power is not used for any collateral purpose. [793 F , 794 C E] (6) The real conclusion. of the Government was that the price fixed was inadequate and hence High Court erred in thinking that the Government was bound to satisfy the Court that there was collusion between the bidders. [794 E F] Barrium Chemicals Ltd. and Anr. vs Company Law Board and Ors. [1966] Supp. S.C.R. 311 and Rohtas Industries Ltd. vs section T. Agarwal; , referred to. (7) The Government was not precluded, having had recourse to the auction method once, from either calling for tender or selling by negotiations. Once the Government declines to accept the highest bid or the tender price offered, the government was free to have recourse to other methods. The pow(* given to the Government to sell in such other manner as it thinks fit is a very wide and unrestricted power and includes within it the power to; sell the privilege by private negotiation. [795 A B] (8) The Government is not required by section 29 (2) (a) to make an order that the privilege will be sold by private negotiation, since, it makes no sense to require Government to first make an order that it is going to negotiate. The section only says that the State Government 'may by general or special order direct ' and the direction contemplated is one to subordinate officials and not to itself. [795 D F] \n",
            "Prediction: The 1st respondent was carrying on the business of selling country liquor in the eight specified shops in the Cuttack District for the period from April 1, 1971 to March 31, 1972. His bids were provisionally accepted by the Collector subject to confirmation by the Government. The Government rejected those bids being of the view that inadequate price had been offered as a result of collusion between the bidders. The Collector ordered the Excise Commissioner to call for tenders in respect of those shops. After the tenders were duly received, the Government accepted the tender in the respect of one shop and rejected the other tenders as it was again of the opinion that the price offered was inadequate.

            "Target: One Ranendra died unmarried on November 16, 1952 leaving the alleged will (Exhibit 1) executed on November, 8, 1952. Ranendra left behind him three brothers Jitendra Chandra Bose, Gopendra and Manindra plaintiff No. 1. Manindra and Jogendra (Plaintiff No. 2) had been appointed executors of the will. By the will Ranendra bequeathed one half of his properties to his nephew, Bhabesh, who was the son of his younger brother, Phanindra, who had predeceased him, and the remaining half to his younger brother Manindra for life, and after Manindra 's death to Bhabesh absolutely. The executors of the will as aforesaid filed an application before the Subordinate Judge. Alipore, for probate of a will executed by Ranendra. Jitendra entered caveat and filed a written statement and contested application for probate. During the pendency of the suit, Jitendra died and his heirs who were substituted, contested the suit. The contentions were that Ranendra was not in a physical or mental condition to execute a will; he was in a semi conscious state of mind and had not the testamentary capacity to execute the alleged will and that the alleged will was brought into existence at the instance, and under the influence of the propounder Manindra; that the signatures of Ranendra on the will were not genuine. The trial court found that the signatures of the testator and the attesting witnesses were genuine and that the provisions of the will was neither unfair nor unnatural. But the trial court dismissed the suit and refused to grant probate of the will on the ground that there were certain \"doubts and suspicions about the condition of the testator 's mind on 8 11 1952\". In appeal before the High Court, the decree of the trial court was set aside and the propounder was granted probate of the will. Dismissing the appeal by certificate granted by the Calcutta High Court under Article 133(1)(b) of the Constitution, the Court, ^ HELD: 1.1. The mode of proving a will does not ordinarily differ from that of proving any other document except to the special requirement of attestation prescribed in the case of a will by section 63 of the Successions Act. [1191 D] 1:2. The onus of proving the will is on the propounder and in the absence of suspicious circumstances surrounding the execution of the will, proof of test a 1189 mentary capacity and the signature of the testator as required by law is sufficient to discharge the onus. Where, however, there are suspicious circumstances, the onus is on the propounder to explain them to the satisfaction of the court before the court accepts the will as genuine. Even where circumstances give rise to doubts, it is for the propounder to satisfy the conscience of the court. The suspicious circumstances may be as to the genuineness of the signatures of the testator, the condition of the testator 's mind, the dispositions made in the will being unnatural, improbable or unfair in the light of relevant circumstances, or there might be other indications in the will to show that the testator 's mind was not free. In such a case the court would naturally expect that all legitimate suspicions should be completely removed before the document is accepted as the last will of the testator. If the propounder himself takes the prominent part in the execution of the will which confers a substantial benefit on him, that is also a circumstance to be taken into account, and the propounder is required to remove the doubts by clear and satisfactory evidence. If the propounder succeeds in removing the suspicious circumstances the court would grant probate, even if the will might be unnatural and might cut off wholly or in part near relations.

It was contended by the assessee that he was not liable to tax on the amounts received as he was not carrying on any vocation and as the receipts were not profits or gains. Held that, in teaching Vedanta the assessee was carrying on a vocation.

Held, further, that the payments made by the disciple, were income received by the assessee from his vocation. In the case of a voluntary payment, no tax can be levied on it if it had been made for reasons purely personal to the donee and unconnected with his office or vocation but it will be taxable if it was made because of the office or the vocation of the donee.

            "Target: The petitioner who was held at the Central Jail in connection with some of the offences committed by him, was served with an order of detention passed by the Commissioner of Police, under sub section (2) of section 3 of the , stating that his detention was necessary with a view to preventing him from \"acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.\" Two days later he was served with the grounds of detention and copies of documents and statements relied upon in the grounds of detention. The Commissioner made a report to the Administrator about the passing of the detention order together with the grounds of detention. The Administrator approved the detention order and sent the report to the Central Government, and also informed the petitioner that the order of detention had been approved by him and that he had a right to make a representation. The case of the petitioner was placed before the Advisory Board who was of the opinion that there was sufficient cause for his detention. The Administrator confirmed the detention order under sub section (1) of section 12 and further directed under section 13 of the Act that the petitioner be detained for a period of 12 months from the date of his detention. In his petition under Article 32 of the Constitution the petitioner contended that: (1) the unexplained delay of two days in furnishing the grounds of detention was a denial of the constitutional imperatives of article 22(5) read with section 8 of the Act which cast a duty on the detaining authority to afford the detenu \"the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order of detention\", (2) there was a failure on the part of the Commissioner as well as the 708 Administrator to apply their minds and specify the period of detention while making the order of detention under sub section (2) of section 3 of the Act, and (3) the grounds of detention served were not connected with \"maintenance of public order\", but relate to \"maintenance of law and order\". Dismissing the petition, ^ HELD: 1. (i) Sub section (1) of section 8 of the Act which is in conformity with Article 22(5) provides that where a person is detained in pursuance of a detention order made under sub section (1) or sub section (2) of section 3 of the Act, the authority making the order shall, \"as soon as may be\", but ordinarily not later than five days and in exceptional circumstances and for reasons to be recorded in writing not later than ten days from the date of detention, communicate to him the grounds on which the order has been made. Parliament has thus by law defined the words \"as soon as may be\" occurring in article 22(5) as meaning normally a period of five days. [711 F] (ii) The law is that the detaining authority must, as soon as may be, i.e. as soon as practicable, communicate to the detenu the grounds on which the order of detention has been made. That period has been specified by section 8 of the Act to mean a period ranging from five to ten days depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. [712 D] In the instant case, the petitioner was served with the grounds of detention within a period of two days i.e. within the period allowed by section 8 of the Act and that was \"as soon as practicable. \" The order of detention is therefore not rendered invalid merely because the grounds of detention were furnished two days later. [712 E F] (iii) In A.K. Roy vs Union of India, [1982] 1 S.C.C. 271 this Court has not laid down that the detaining authority making an order of detention under sub section (1) or sub section (2) of section 3 of the Act or the authority approving of the same, must specify the period of detention in the order. [714 B] 2. Under the scheme of the Act, the period of detention must necessarily vary according to the exigencies of each case i.e. the nature of the prejudicial activity complained of. It is not that the period of detention must in all circumstances extend to the maximum period of 12 months as laid down in section 13 of the Act. [714 E] 3.(i) The true distinction between the areas of 'public order ' and 'law and order ' lies not in the nature or quality of the act, but in the degree and extent of its reach upon society. The distinction between the two concepts of 'law and order ' and 'public order ' is a fine one but this does not mean that there can be no overlapping. Acts similar in nature but committed in different contexts and circumstances might cause different reactions. In one case it might affect specific individuals only and therefore touch the problem of 'law and order ' while in another it might affect 'public order '. The act by itself therefore is not determinant of its own gravity. It is the potentiality of the act to disturb the even 709 tempo of the life of the community which make it prejudicial to the 'maintenance of public order. ' [715 C E] (ii) Preventive detention is devised to afford protection to society. The object is not to punish a man for having done something but to intercept before he does it and to prevent him from doing. Justification for such detention is suspicion or reasonable probability and not criminal conviction which can only be warranted by legal evidence. It follows that any preventive measures, even if they involve some restraint or hardship upon individuals, do not partake in any way of the nature of punishment, but are taken by way of precaution to prevent mischief to the State. [715 F G] (iii) The Executive can take recourse to its power of preventive detention in those cases where the Court is genuinely satisfied that no prosecution could possibly succeed against the detenu because he is a dangerous person who has overawed witnesses or against whom no one is prepared to depose. [716 B] (iv) What essentially is a problem relating to 'law and order ' may due to sudden sporadic and intermittent acts of physical violence on innocent victims in a metropolitan city result in serious 'public disorder '. It is the length, magnitude and intensity of the terror wave, unleashed by a particular act of violence creating disorder that distinguished it as an act affecting 'public order ' from that concerning 'law and order '. Some offences primarily injure specific individuals and only secondarily the public interest, while others directly injure the public interest, and affect individuals only remotely. [717 D E] In the instant case the particular acts enumerated in the grounds of detention clearly shows that the activities of the detenu cover a wide field and fall within the contours of the concept of 'public order '.

The Arbitrators made their Award on 18th April, 1961, allowing the claim of the appellant with costs against the respondent. In response to the notice of filing the Award in the Court, the respondent filed objections to the Award on several grounds such as denial of the existence of the agreement of reference, that he was not a member of the Exchange, that the Contract Notes had not been signed by him, that the arbitrators had mis conducted themselves and the proceedings, that the Award had been improperly procured etc. Negativing all the objections, the Sub Judge Delhi recorded the findings that the Contract Notes bore the signatures of the respondent and as such under the arbitration clause contained in each one of them read with the relevant Bye laws there was a valid Agreement for Reference to arbitration made the Award a rule of the Court and passed a decree in favour of the appellant on 7.9.1962. 568 In the first appeal preferred to the High Court, a learned Single Judge of the Delhi High Court entertained a doubt as to whether the respondent could be said to be a party to the actual Reference to arbitration even though each of the Contract Notes containing the arbitration clause was signed by the respondent, since the respondent had not joined in nominating his arbitrator despite service of notice asking him to do so, and whether on that account the Reference could be said to be unilateral, referred the same to a larger Bench on 5.1.1971. The Full Bench answered the question in favour of the respondent, relying on certain observations made by the Supreme Court in Seth Thawardas Pherumal vs Union of India reported in (1955) 2 SCR P. 48 and took the view that notwithstanding the fact that respondent had signed the Contract Notes and had thereby become consenting party to the arbitration agreement tho actual reference to arbitration of the two arbitrators required the assent of both the parties and since to such reference the respondent had not given his consent it was a unilateral reference to arbitration and as such the resultant Award would not be binding on the respondent. Hence the appeal by special leave. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1.1 The question whether fresh assent of both the parties for the actual reference is necessary or not must depend upon whether arbitration agreement is a bare agreement or it is an arbitration agreement as defined in section 2(a) of the Act. If it is the latter, then, clearly the actual reference to arbitration would be consensual and not unilateral and no fresh assent of the parties would be necessary nor will resort to section 20 be necessary. Instead the party desirous of going to arbitration can resort to remedies available to him under Chapter II of the ; and in a case like the instant one he can, as the appellant, did, proceed under the relevant Bye laws. [582 C E] 1.2 It is true that the defines the two expressions \"arbitration agreement\" and \"reference\" separately. Section 2(a) defines an \"arbitration agreement\" to mean \"a written agreement to submit present or future differences to arbitration, whether an arbitrator is named therein or not '` while section 2(e) defines a \"reference\" to mean \"a reference to arbitration\". The latter expression obviously refers to an actual reference made jointly by the parties after disputes have arisen between them referring the said disputes for adjudication to a named arbitrator or arbitrators, while the former expression is wider as it combines within itself two concepts, (a) a bare agreement between the parties that disputes arising between them should be decided or resolved through arbitration and (b) an actual reference of a particular dispute or disputes for adjudication to a named arbitrator or arbitrators. If that be so, it stands to reason that only when the arbitration agreement is of the former type, namely, a bare agreement a separate reference to arbitration with fresh assent of both the parties will be necessary and in the absence of such concensual reference resort to section 20 of the will be essential but where the arbitration agreement conforms to the definition given in section 2(a), the party desiring arbitration can straightaway approach the arbitrator or arbitrators and resort to section 20 of is unnecessary because 569 consent to such actual reference to arbitration shall be deemed to be there as the second concept is included in the agreement signed by the parties, and the aspect that differences or disputes actually arose subsequently would be inconsequential because the arbitration agreement as defined in section 2(a) covers not merely present but future differences also In other words, in such a case there will be no question of there being any unilateral reference. In every case the question will have to be considered as to whether the arbitration agreement is a bare agreement of the type indicated earlier or an arbitration agreement as defined in section 2(a) of the Act. [574 D A; 575 A C] 2.1 On a plain reading of the arbitration clause contained in the Contract Notes read with relevant Bye laws it is abundantly clear that the arbitration agreement herein is not a bare arbitration agreement but is clearly an arbitration agreement as defined in section 2(a) of the of 1940. In other words, the assent of the parties to actual reference is already there in the agreement; in addition there is a statutory reference. Therefore, the reference being consensual (and also statutory) the resultant award would be valid and binding on the parties to the transactions. This case was not a case of unilateral reference. Resort to section 20 of the on the part of the appellant before approaching the arbitrators for adjudication was unnecessary and the Award was and is binding on the respondent. [577 H; 578 A C] 2.2 The arbitration clause contained in the Contract Notes read with relevant Bye laws make two or three things very clear. In the first place the arbitration clause is couched in a very wide language inasmuch as it makes arbitrable not merely the claims or disputes arising out of the transactions specified in the Contract Note but also \"all claims differences and disputes in respect of any dealings, transactions and contracts of a date prior or subsequent to the date of this Contract (including any question whether such dealings, transactions or contracts have been entered into or not)\". Secondly the arbitration clause incorporates a provision that all such claims, differences and disputes shall be submitted to and decided by arbitration\" in Delhi as provided in the Rules, Regulations and Bye laws of the Exchange; this is a pointer to consensual submission in the clause. Thirdly, Bye laws 247(a) which governs these transactions in terms constitutes the actual reference to arbitration and under Bye laws 248(a) and 249(1) the reference is to two arbitrators who would be the nominees of each one of the parties to the disputes and provision is made empowering the Board of Directors or President to appoint arbitrator in case a party fails to nominate his own; in other words once a contract is made subject to Rules, Regulations and Bye laws (framed under the rule making power) there comes into existence a statutory submission or reference to arbitration. [577 D H] 3.1 The true scope and effect of the observations of the Court in Seth Thawardas Pherumal 's case must be read in the proper perspective and not in a truncated manner or divorced from the context of specific issue which arose for determination before the Court in that case. It will be clear that these were neither intended to apply generally to all references nor to lay down the wide proposition that there can be no reference to arbitration except through the 570 Court under section 20 unless both parties join in it. The observations were made in the context of the specific issue that arose before this Court and were not and are not intended to apply generally to all references. The statement that in the absence of either, agreement by both sides about the terms of reference, or an order of the Court under section 20(4) compelling a reference the arbitrator is not vested with the necessary exclusive jurisdiction ' makes it clear that the observations were confined to the references of specific questions of law. Ordinarily the Court has jurisdiction to set aside an award if an illegality or an error of law appears on the face of it and it is only when a specific question of law has been referred to the arbitrator for adjudication that his decision thereon falls within his exclusive jurisdiction and cannot be interfered with by the Court howsoever erroneous it might be. The true effect of these observations is that even in the case of an arbitration agreement which squarely falls within the definition of that expression as given in section 2 and which is not a bare arbitration agreement there would be included in it a consensual actual reference by the parties of all their disputes including questions of law that may arise later but the arbitrator 's award on such questions of law would not be within his exclusive jurisdiction since specific question or questions of law cannot be said to have been referred to him as required by the law of arbitration but though the reference would be valid the award and his decisions on questions of law is erroneous on the face of it would be liable to be set aside by the Court. This is for from laying down the wide proposition that there can be no reference to arbitration except through the Court under section 20 unless both the parties join afresh in the actual reference.

Birla, described to be a technician with experience in the business of manufacturing and selling Stapple Fibres, and the Thai Rayon Company, Thailand, engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling Stapple Fibres, entered into an agreement wherein the respondent was stated to be approached by the Thai Company to make his services available to the Company as his 'employer ', in Bangkok, on certain terms and conditions, for which the Company would pay him remuneration receivable at Bangkok. The agreement was for a period of three years and was subject to the approval of the Governments of India and Thailand, etc. The respondent applied to the Government of India for its approval of his employment with the Thai Company under the agreement; for the purpose of securing the benefits conferred by section 80 RRA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The Government declined to accord its approval to the respondent 's employment with the Thai Company on the terms and conditions contained in the agreement, for the purpose of section 80 RRA, on the ground that the section, according to its view, contemplates rendering service outside India in the status of an 'employee ', whereas the status of the respondent under the foreign employer was that of a 'consultant ' and not an 'employee ', and that, therefore, the remuneration contemplated under section 80 RRA would be applicable to the case of the respondent and the benefit of the section could not be given to him. The respondent moved the High Court for relief against the decision of the Government. A learned Single Judge of the High Court quashed the order of the Government and directed it to reconsider the case of the respondent. The Letters Patent Appeal against the order of the Single Judge was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court.

Further the terms and conditions of his service outside India must be approved by the Government of India. Furthermore, in his case the deduction of the section would not be allowed In respect of the remuneration if the service related to any period after the expiry of 36 months. He was not employed beyond the period of 36 months. Indisputably, the sum concerned in the case, fee, was remuneration, being the amount paid in lieu of 'services ' rendered.

The mercy petitions to the President and the peti tion for direction to tiffs Court having been rejected the petitioner 's father moved the instant review petition. Dismissing the petition the Court. HELD: (1) This court 's review power has repeatedly been invoked ire vain and naturally a further exercise of the same power must be justified by the compelling pressure of fresh circumstances within the limits of law. Recognised grounds such as manifest injustice induced by obvious curial error or oversight or new and important matter not reasona bly within the ken or reach of the party seeking review on the prior occasion, may warrant interference to further justice. (2) Under the Indian Penal Code death penalty has been ruled to be constitutional. The law having sanctioned it and this Court having refused special leave against convic tion and sentence in this very case, it is a vanquished cause to argue for a vague illegality vitiating capital sentence as such. [179 D E] Gregg vs Georoia, U.S. Supreme Court decided on July 2, 1976 held not applicable. (3) In India under present conditions deterrence through death penalty may not be a time barred punishment in some frightful areas of barbarous murder. illustratively the court has mentioned that the brutal features of the crime and the hapless and helpless state of the victim steel the heart of the law to impose the sterner sentence. [180 A B] Ediga Annamina vs State of A.P., ; ex plained. (4) The law is thus harsh and humane and when faced with arguments about the social invalidity of the death penalty the personal predilections of the judge must bow to the law. The Bench with all its will to break through is bound by a jurisdictional servitude. This fetter is that if there is no legal ground for the alleged grievances the court cannot grant relief. The court enters a province of \"powerless power\" and finds itself in a quandary between codified law and progressive thought. The latter beckons, but the former binds [180 B, 177 F G] (5) Hearing is obligatory at the sentencing stage under the new Criminal Procedure Code. The humanist principle of individualising punishment to suit the person and his cir cumstances is best served by hearing the culprit even on the nature and quantum of the penalty to be imposed. (6) The heinousness of the crime is a relevant factor in the choice of the sentence. The circumstances of the crime, especially social pressures which induce the crime which may be epitomised as \"a just sentence in an unjust society\" are another considerations. The criminal. not the crime. must figure prominently in shaping the sentence where a reform of the individual, rehabilitation into society and other meas ures to prevent recurrence, are weighty factors. Sombre sentencing is the Fifth Act in the tragedy of a murder trial and for the judges of the Supreme Court, assumes a grim seriousness and poignant gravity. The Penal Code does not give the judge a free hand where murder has been made out. The choice is painfully not quite scientifical ly though limited to but two alternatives.

            "Target: M/s Dabur India Limited, petitioner in one set of peti tions, is a public limited company engaged in the manufac ture of Ayurvedic as well as Allopathic medicaments, along with cosmetics. It used to manufacture for and on behalf of M/s Sharda Boiren Laboratories The petitioner in the second set of petitions a Homeopathic tooth paste called 'Homeo dent ' out of the raw materials supplied by M/s Sharda, on job basis. It accordingly manufactured Homeodent during 1985 to 1988, duly paying duties of excise on Homeodent under the Central Excises & Salt Act, 1944. The Superintendent of State Excise visited the factory of M/s Dabur on 18th January, 1988 and enquired about the excisability of Homeodent under the Medicinal & Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955. He was told that Homeodent had been classified under the 1944 Act in view of the orders passed by the Central Excise authorities. Howev er, when it was revealed that the Homeodent tooth paste was toilet preparation containing alcohol, within the meaning of section 2(k), read with Item 4 of the Schedule, referred to in section 3 of the 1955 Act, the District Excise Officer caused a common notice dated 17.3.1988 to be served on M/s Dabur requiring it to pay duty aggregating to Rs.68,13,334.20 under the provisions of the 1955 Act on such 295 goods manufactured and cleared between January 1985 and January 1988. This order was passed without issuing any notice to show cause, and without affording any opportunity of hearing, to the petitioner. The Petitioner sent a representation requesting for compliance with the principles of natural justice and also disputing the amount claimed as duty. On 18th March, 1988 the Superintendent of State Excise modified the earlier order and confirmed the demand of duty amounting to Rs.46.67 lakhs, on provisional basis. On that day the petitioner deposited a sum of Rs. 11.66 lakhs and further executed a bank guarantee for the balance. Simultaneously, the peti tioner appealed against the order dated 18th March, 1988. The Excise Commissioner dismissed the appeal. No appeal was filed by M/s Sharda against the demand notice of excise duty under the 1955 Act. The petitioner moved the High Court. On 13th May, 1988 the High Court directed the petitioner to file a revision petition with the Central Government. Both the petitioners then approached the Central Government in revision. On 22nd September, 1988 the Additional Secretary to the Government of India in exercise of his revisional powers allowed the revision filed by M/s Dabur and declared the orders of the District Excise Officer and the Excise Commissioner as null and void having been passed in violation of the principles of natural justice. The revision filed by M/s Sharda was not entertained by the Central Government on the ground that a right of appeal was vested in Sharda, which was not availed of. The High Court dismissed Sharda 's petition challenging the order of the Central Government declining to entertain its review. Against the order of the High Court M/s Sharda have filed the special leave petition in this Court. On the basis of the revision order, the petitioners called upon the District Excise Officer to refund the amount of Rs.46.67 lakhs recovered from it by way of cash payment and encashment of bank guarantee. The State Excise authori ties however failed to grant the refund, and instead issued a fresh show cause notice to the petitioners jointly on 2nd November, 1988. In December 1988, M/s Dabur moved the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution for quashing and setting aside the showcase notice dated 2.11.1988 and for refund of duty amounting to Rs.46.67. The High Court dismissed the writ petition. The High Court was 296 of the opinion that the question whether Homeodent tooth paste was sans alcohol could not be adjudicated upon under the extraordinary writ jurisdiction. The High Court however came to the conclusion that both the 1944 and 1955 Acts operated in different fields and there was no overlapping between the two. The High Court further observed that where the parties fully acquiesced with the matter and subjected themselves to the statutory procedure, no action should be allowed to be taken under Article 226 of the Constitution unless the case was patently without jurisdiction. In this connection, it was emphasised by the High Court that once the parties chose the statutory procedure they must go to the logical end. It was inter alia urged before this Court on behalf of the petitioner that it was not seeking to circumvent the alternative remedy provided under the Act but in view of the conflicting claims of the Central and State Excise authori ties seeking to classify Homeodent tooth paste under the respective Acts of 1944 and 1955, the petitioner was left with no other alternative but to challenge the actions by way of writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. It was further contended that Homeodent did not contain alcohol but contained ingredient \"mother tincture\" contain ing alcohol, which had a tendency to evaporate during the process of manufacture of Homeodent; that no test result as required under the 1955 Act was obtained to establish wheth er Homeodent contained alcohol or not; and that on 31st August, 1987 the Assistant Collector of Central Excise had already passed an order classifying Homeodent under the Act of 1944 which order had been upheld by the Collector of Central Excise (Appeals). The main point that the petitioner sought to emphasis was that the High Court ought to have appreciated that Homeodent tooth paste having been subjected to duty under the provisions of the 1944 Act, the question of levying and recovering duty under the 1955 Act did not and could not arise. Dismissing the petitions, this Court, HELD: (1) Homeodent is a homeopathic preparation but it is also a tooth paste. Therefore, it is a toilet prepara tion. Whether or not such Homeodent would not be dutiable under the Medicinal & Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955 would depend upon whether it contained alcohol or not. [315E] (2) It is undisputed that mother tincture was one of the components that was used in the preparation of Homeodent and it has been found that alcohol was there and mother tincture was added in the 297 medicinal preparation as its component.

(3) The authorities charged with the duties of enforcing a particular Act are enjoined with the task of determining the question whether alcohol is contained therein or not. [310D] (4) It has been determined by the authorities enjoined to enforce the 1955 Act that Homeodent was a medicinal and toilet preparation and liable to excise duty, and such finding has not been assailed on any cogent ground in any proper manner. If that is the position, then it must be upheld that Homeodent was dutiable. [317D] Union of India vs Bombay Tyre International Ltd., ; ; Mohanlal Magan Lal Bhavsar vs Union of India, and N.B. Sanjana, Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Bombay vs The Elphinston Spinning and Weav ing Mills Co. Ltd.; , , referred to. (5) Provisions for rebate of duty on alcohol contained in section 4 of the 1955 Act show that multipoint tax on medicinal preparations containing alcohol was within the contemplation, otherwise there was no purpose in incorporat ing section 4 into the Act. [316B] (6) Justice requires that provisions for claiming refund of this duty should be made more clear. However, in the view of the facts and the circumstances that have happened, it is directed that if the petitioners are entitled to any refund of the duty already paid to the Central Government in view of the duty imposition now upheld against them in favour of the State Government such refund application should be entertained and considered in accordance with law. [316E F] (7) In a case of this nature, where there is some doubt as to whether duty was payable to the Central Government under the 1944 Act or whether the item was dutiable under the 1955 Act, it would be just and proper and in consonance with justice infiscal administration that the Central Gov ernment should consider in the light of the facts found, if an application is made under section 11B of the 1944 Act, and circumstances of this case, the limitation period under section 11B of the 1944 Act should not apply. This direction must be confined in the facts and the circumstances of this case only. [316G H; 317A] 298 Citadel Fine Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd. vs D.R.O., [1973] Mad.

(8) Government should consider feasibility of a machin ery under a Council to be formed under Article 263 of the Constitution to adjudicate and adjust the dues of the re spective Governments. [318D] (9) This Court would not like to hear from a litigant in this country that the Government is coercing citizens of this country to make payment which the litigant is contend ing not leviable. Government, of course, is entitled to enforce payment and for that purpose to take all legal steps but the Government, Central or State, cannot be permitted to play dirty games with the citizens to coerce them in making payments which the citizens were not legally obliged to make. If any money is due to the Government, the Government should take steps but not take extra legal steps or manoeu vre. Therefore, the right of renewal of the petitioner of licence must be judged and attended to in accordance with law and the occasion not utilised to coerce the petitioners to a course of action not warranted by law and procedure.

But, the very basis of a prosecution for adulteration of food is the report of the Public Analyst that the article of food is adulterated The accused is given the right to dispute the Public Analyst 's report by applying to the court for an analysis by the Central Food Laboratory If the report of the Central Food Laboratory is to the effect that the article of food is not adulterated the very basis of the prosecution will disappear. In such an event the further pursuit of the prosecution will be needless and the accused will have to be discharged or acquitted as the case may be. It is therefore to be assumed that the report of the Public Analyst is to be made available to the accused vendor at the commencement of the prosecution, that is to say, before the prosecution starts leading evidence in the case, and in good and sufficient time to enable the accused to exercise his right of having the sample analysed by the Central Food Laboratory if he so desires it. There fore Rule 9A carefully refrains from mentioning any definite limit of time and the expression \"immediately\" is not to be understood to mean the very next instant, the very next hour, that very day or the very next day. Construed in its setting, the expression \"immediately\" is only meant to convey 'reasonable despatch and promptitude ' and no more. The idea is to avoid dilatoriness on the part of official dom and prevention of unnecessary harassment to the accused. But the idea is not to penalise the prosecution and to provide a technical defence. If after receiving the Public Analyst 's report the accused never sought to apply to the court to have the sample sent to the Central Food Laboratory, as in the present case, he may not be heard to complain of the delay in the receipt of the report by him, unless, of course, he is able to establish some other prejudice.

The mixing of cotton seed oil with soyabean oil is adulteration of soyabean oil incurring liability to be convicted under section 16(1) (a) (i) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. The sale of an article of food the sale of which is prohibited by any rule made under the Act also renders the person selling the article of food liable to punishment under section 16 (l) (i). Rule 44(e) prohibits the sale of a mixture of two or more edible oils as an edible oil. A mixture of soyabean oil and cotton seed oil cannot therefore be sold as soyabean oil irrespective of whether the mixture has affected the soya bean oil injuriously or not. [961E G] \n",

            "Target: The respondent a firm carrying on business in Singapore filed a plaint in the firm name against the appellants for the breach of contract. The plaint had been signed and verified on behalf of the firm by one 'D ' on a power of attorney executed by one of the partners only. After about, 6 years the respondents made an application for the amendment of the plaint. The amendment sought was to the effect that the name of the firm as plaintiff be struck off, as it was a misdescription and in its place and stead the names of five partners of the firm should be brought on record in order to bring the controversy between the proper parties into clear relief. The amendment petition was rejected, inter alia, on the grounds that the original plaint was no plaint in law and it was not a case of misnomer or misdescription, nor a case of a nonexistent firm or a non existent person, but a legal bar, as the plaint was a nullity. The proper course when there is such a mistake is not to amend disregarding the condition of 0. i r. 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure but to seek the Court 's permission to withdraw the suit with liberty to file a fresh suit under 0. 23 r. i of the Civil Procedure Code on the ground of formal defect and which should be done before limitation. In appeal the High Court came to the conclusion that the description of a plaintiff by a firm name in a case where the Code of Civil Procedure does not permit a suit to be brought in the firm name should properly be considered a case of description of the individual partners of the business and as such a misdescription, which in law can be corrected and should not be considered to amount to a description of non existent person. It also rejected the contention that the power of attorney in favour of D was insufficient. 983 Held, that the word, ' firm\" or the \"firm name \" in section 4 Of the Indian Partnership Act is merely a compendious description of all the partners collectively. Where a suit is filed in the name of a firm it is still a suit by all the partners of the firm unless it is proved that all the partners had not authorised the suit. The provision of 0. XXX r. 1 & 2 of the Code of Civil Pro cedure are enabling provisions to permit several firms who are doing business as partners to sue or be sued in the name of the firm and do not prevent the partners of a firm from suing or being sued in their individual names, nor do they prohibit the partners of a firm suing in India in their names individually although they may be doing business outside India; since a firm is not a legal entity the privilege of suing in the name of a firm is permissible only to those persons, who as partners are doing business in India. Such privilege is not extended to persons who are doing business as partners outside India. In their case they still have to sue in their individual names. If however, under some misapprehension, persons doing business as partners outside India do file a plaint in the name of their firm they are misdescribing themselves, as the suit instituted is by them, they being known collectively as a firm. A plaint filed in a court in India in the name of a firm doing business outside India is not by itself a nullity. It is a plaint by all the partners of the firm with a defective description of themselves for the purpose of the Code of Civil Procedure. A civil court could permit under provisions of section 153 of the Code an amendment of the plaint to enable a proper description of the plaintiffs to appear in it in order to assist the court in determining the real question or issue between the parties. Neither r. 10(i) nor r. 10(2) of Order I have any application to a case of this kind, as the suit had been from its very inception a suit by the partners of the firm and no question of adding or substituting any person arises, the partners collectively being described as a firm with a particular name. Held, further, that it is not necessary that the power of attorney should be signed by all the partners of the firm. A partner is an agent of the firm and there is no prohibition to a partner executing a power of attorney in favour of an individual authorising him to institute a suit on behalf of the firm.

            "Prediction: The respondent was a firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932 carrying on business at No. 55 Canning Street, Calcutta. In July, 1949, there was a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant under which the defendant was to sell to the former, subject to certain conditions, 950 bales of Heavy Cees gunny bags c. i. f.

The defendant did not perform the contract entered into by the parties and as a result of the default on the part of the defendant the plaintiff had suffered loss.

            "Target: Respondents in each of these appeals could not clear the LLM examination in accordance with Regulation 7 of the Punjab University Regulations either in the first attempt or later while taking on compartmental basis even after addition of grace marks as laid down in Rule 27(1)(b) of the University Regulations. The respondents filed separate writ petitions praying for a direction to give the benefit of moderation grace mark as calculated under Rule 27(1)(a). The High Court rejected the plea of the Appellant University holding that it was Rule 27(1)(b) that applied and not Rule 27 1(a). Hence the appeal by Special Leave. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD : A bare reading of the Rule 27 (referred to as the Regulations by the High Court) makes it clear that clause (a) is applicable where the full examination is taken and clause (b) is attracted where the candidate reappears to clear the compartment or subject and part in which he has been declared eligible to reappear. In each of these cases the candidate was reappearing to clear the paper in which he or she had failed; clause (b) was clearly attracted and the benefit under clause (a) was not available. The language of clause (b) is such as would squarely apply to such a situation. The provision in clause (b) is clear and on reappearing the candidate becomes entitled to grace marks of up to one per cent of the total marks of the subject/subjects in which he reappears. Once clause (b) applies no reference is available to the performance in the regular examination taken earlier and the benefit of grace marks to the extent indicated has to be confined to the performance at the reappearance. Once this is the position each of the candidates was not eligible to pass. [34GH, 35B C] [In view of the declaration dated 19.6.1980 made before the court, that irrespective of the result of the appeals, the candidates will be declared to have passed, the Court as a special case did not want to disturb the result.] [35D] 32 Observation: The position obtaining in the Punjab University in respect of Post Graduate degrees namely grace marks being awarded is disapproved. A Master 's degree in any speciality is considered to be the highest qualification in the normal run. It is very much necessary that such a degree should be conferred only on the deserving students who having studied the subject and taken the appropriate examination conducted by the University at the end of such studies have deserved the degree on the basis of their performance. There should be no scope for looking for grace marks at such level and the sooner the Punjab University abandons the practice of awarding grace marks in respect of post graduate examinations the better it would be in the interest of higher education in this country.

The University authorities took the view that Rule 27.1(b) authorised addition of the grace marks of up to 1 per cent on the marks secured in the subject/s in which the candidate reappeared and as with that benefit given the candidates did not pass, they were found not to have been successful. The High Court referred to the rule and observed: \"The only question to be seen is whether Regulation 27(a) is applicable or not. \" Each of the respondents failed to satisfy the requirements of Rule 7 and being eligible to clear the subject in which he failed on compartmental basis reappeared in such subject in the next examination.

            "Target: In May, 1974 the Higher Judicial Service for the State of UP was constituted, and the post of Civil and Sessions Judge was abolished. The U.P. State Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975 came into force with effect from May 10, 1975. The petitioners State Judicial Service Officers who were promoted on various dates to the Higher Judicial Service and posted as Additional District Judges/Civil and Sessions Judges before 1974, filed writ petitions in this Court challenging their inter se seniority, vis a vis, direct recruits contending that, on their confirmation, they were given seniority from a date chosen by the High Court arbitrarily, instead of from the date of their continuous officiation, which had resulted in their being placed much below the officers appointed much later by direct recruitment, that there was no provision for direct recruitment to the Higher Judicial Service before the 1975 rules were brought into force and all the existing vacancies on that date were to be filled by only promotion, and therefore, the High Court, while confirming and giving the dates for the purpose of seniority, ought to have prepared a list of a vacancies existing on the date the rules came into force and confirmed all those who were officiating as Additional and District Judges or Civil and Sessions Judges on that day in all those vacancies. They also contended that while computing the seniority only three years were counted whereas they should have been given advantage of continuous officiation as they were officiating in the posts before the 1975 rules came into existence. 399 The aforesaid petitions were contested by the High Court contending that as it became necessary to fill in the temporary posts the formality of examining record and consideration by a Committee or the Full Court was not done, and all the petitioners were appointed only on the basis of seniority and not in accordance with the rules and, therefore, they could not be treated as appointed on probation from the date of their officiation and that even if an officer had been continuously working for more than three years, still for the purpose of computing seniority only three years will be counted as per proviso to Rule 26. Allowing the writ petitions partly, ^ HELD: 1.1 The period of officiation has to be considered as period of probation and the confirmation has to be from the date on which earliest a vacancy was available and the seniority has to be counted on that basis. [406A] 1.2 Before the U.P. Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1975 were brought into force, there was no rule requiring direct recruitment and hence all the posts available were to be filled by promotion. In view of this, and in view of proviso to Rule 8, all the posts (permanent) available in the Higher Judicial Service plus thirty one temporary posts existing on that date, which may become permanent later, should be filled by promotion from amongst the members of the Nyayika Sewa. Some of the posts may be occupied by promotees officers who were given promotions on ad hoc basis and working on these posts or that the posts may be Lying vacant. Whatever may be the situation the matter will have to be gone into afresh by the High Court and all the posts in the Higher Judicial Service available as on May 10, 1974 plus thirty one posts have to be filled from the officers of the Nyayika Sewa. [403C, 406E G] 1.3 In view of Para 3 of the Rules and the Notification abolishing the posts of Civil and Sessions Judges, all those officers who were officiating as Civil and Sessions Judges on 8th May, 1974 automatically became Additional District and Sessions Judges. What has been contemplated in Rule 20 could not be applied retrospectively for promotions before 1975. What was left was only a consideration of their cases of confirmation. In doing so, the only thing that could be kept in view is the date on which a vacancy (permanent) was available for their confirmation and the seniority of those officers will have to be reckoned in accordance with the date of confirmation which will be not the actual date of confirmation but a date when a post was available, and in so doing, it will not also be reasonable to fix any date, as has been done by 400 the High Court arbitrarily on the assumption that actually when they were promoted they were not promoted after following the procedure. The only thing that can be considered will be that if at the time of confirmation an officer was not found fit naturally he must have been reverted, and the question of ms seniority in the Higher Judicial Service, therefore, will not arise. [407G H, 408B E] So far as the posts available on 10th May, 1974 is concerned, the High Court will have to look into the matter afresh and decide the seniority. But after the rules came into force, the Rules will have to be given effect to. [408H, 409A] 2.1 In Rule 22 the phrase used is \"to make appointment to the service on the occurrence of substantive vacancies\". The substantive vacancy has not been defined in the Rules. But the scheme of the rules clearly indicates that there are permanent posts and temporary posts also which are created to meet contingency and it may in due course be made permanent. Therefore, when appointment under Rule 22 is contemplated in the service of substantive vacancies, it may be both temporary or permanent. But the vacancy must be in the cadre. A person could only be confirmed when the permanent post is available for him. It is clear from cl. (3) of Rule 22 that appointment to temporary vacancies shall be made from the Nyayika Sewa and as and when a substantive vacancies arises the procedure for selection should be followed and the officers who were appointed to fill in the temporary post should be considered first and appointed on probation if found fit. [410D F, 410H 411A] 2.2 Normally the period of probation shall be two years. In computing this period of probation, an officer who has been continuously officiating immediately prior to his appointment on probation will also be taken into account and the period of probation in any event shall not exceed three years. Proviso 2 to Rule 26 provides that in the case of promotee officers a maximum period of continuous officiation in the service shall not, for the purpose of determining seniority, exceed three years immediately preceding the date of confirmation. This is consistent with the Rule 23 which provides that total period of probation shall not ordinarily exceed three years. [412A B, C D] These principles of seniority will apply only to the promotions made after the rules came into force. The scheme of the rules is that if a person is appointed to officiate in the Higher Judicial Service his case for confirmation will normally be considered within three years and either he will be confirmed or reverted and the High Court is expected 401 to examine the case of the promotee officer within three years and decide whether the officer deserves to be confirmed or reverted. [412E F] By laying down that the period of probation shall not ordinarily exceed three years and that only three years of continuous officiation will be counted for purposes of seniority in the case of promotee officers, the rules contemplate that there will not be an occassion when there may be a person officiating for more than three years and his case has not yet been considered for confirmation. [412G H] Ordinarily, if the Rules were brought into force the appointments to the Higher Judicial Service, either on the basis of direct recruitment or on the basis of promotion, must have been in accordance with the Rules and it is expected that the probation, confirmation and the seniority must have been looked into by the High Court strictly in accordance with the Rules. [413A B] 3. About the appointments on the posts available before these Rules were brought into force and to fill in temporary posts, the matter will have to be examined afresh by the High Court and the posts available on 10th May, 1974 plus thirty one posts will have to be filled in only by promotees. Thereafter the High Court should examine the cases of promotion and direct recruitment, after coming into force of these Rules, and the vacancies available. After considering the cases in accordance with these Rules, the High Court will prepare afresh the seniority list which may be notified so that if any objections are raised they may be placed for determination in accordance with the Rules.

            "Prediction: The petitioners are officers of the State Judicial Service who have been promoted on various dates to the higher judicial service and posted as Additional District Judges or some of them were posted as Civil and Sessions Judges before 1974 as in 1974 the post of Civil & Sessions Judge has been abolished and the Higher Judicial Service for the State of Uttar Pradesh was constituted. The petitioners challenged the inter se seniority of the officers in the higher Judicial service coming from two sources; i) promoted from the judicial service, and ii) others who are directly recruited from the Bar. In 1975 the present rules for recruitment of the judicial officers came into force. Before these rules were brought into force, the earlier rules were declared to be bad and in substance therefore, before these Rules were brought in force, there was no provision for direct recruitment to the Higher judicial service. The respondents contended that all the vacancies existing on the date on which these rules (1975 Rules) came in force have to be filled in by promotion.\n",

            "Target: The T.V. Serial 'Honi Anhoni ' was being telecast by Doordarshan on every Thursday between 9.00 P.M. and 9.30 P.M. A writ petition was filed by the Respondents stating that the telecast was not in public interest as it had the effect of confirming blind faiths, superstitious beliefs in stories of ghosts, rebirth, precognition etc. and of spreading the unscientific way of thinking and blind beliefs. The High Court issued an interim order of injunction not to telecast and show episodes 12 and 13 of the serial. Aggrieved by the interim order, the appellant, producer of the said serial, had come on appeal by special leave. This Court, while granting special leave stayed the operation of the interim order passed by the High Court. The appellant contended that the said serial and in particular episodes 12 and 13 did not emphasise superstitious beliefs but on the contrary criticised and condemned superstition and blind faith, and at the end of both the episodes a doctor and a professor gave a scientific explanation for the unusual occurrences portrayed therein and considered by people as supernatural phenomenon. It was also submitted that the viewers were told that they should search for scientific reason whenever any unusual occurrence takes place. Allowing the appeal, 487 ^ HELD:1. Freedom of expression is a preferred right which is always very zealously guarded by this Court. It can no longer be disputed that the right of a citizen to exhibit films on the Doordarshan subject to the terms and conditions to be imposed by the Doordarshan is a part of the fundamental right of freedom of expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India which can be curtailed only under circumstances which are set out in clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India. The right is similar to the right of a citizen to publish his views through any other media such as newspaper, magazines, advertisement hoardings etc. subject to the terms and conditions of the owners of the media. [491B; 490C E] 2. The High Court was in error in the present case in issuing the interim order of injunction which is set aside. [492B] 3.1 The objection to the exhibition of the film was that it was likely to spread false or blind beliefs amongst the members of the public. The Respondents had not asserted any right conferred on them by any statute or acquired by them under a contract which entitled them to secure an order of temporary injunction. [491C D] 3.2 As alleged by the Respondents, if all the episodes in the serial were offensive they could have approached the High Court as early as possible within the first two or three weeks after the commencement of the exhibition of the serial. But they waited till the exhibition of the 11th episode of the serial was over and then filed the petition. They had not produced any material apart from their own statements to show that the exhibition of the serial was prima facie prejudicial to the community. [491E G] 3.3 The High Court overlooked that the issue of an order of interim injunction in this case could infringe a fundamental right of the producer of the serial. In the absence of any prima facie evidence of grave prejudice that was likely to be caused to the public generally by the exhibition of the serial it was not just and proper to issue an order of temporary injunction. The exhibition of the serial in question was not likely to endanger public morality. In the circumstances of the case the balance of convenience lay in favour of the rejection of the prayer for interim injunction.

It was contended by the State that although the respondents had put in more than three years service, their appointments were temporary and could be terminated for that reason, even if the termination could not strictly b said to fall within the purview of rule 12.21. Dismissing the appeal. the Court ^ HELD: If rules 12.2(3) and 12.21 are read together, it will appear that the maximum period of probation in the case of a police officer of the rank of constable is three years and the power of discharge cannot be exercised under rule 12.21 after expiry of that period. If it is proposed to deal with an inefficient police officer after the expiry of three years, it is necessary to do so in accordance with the rules of Chapter XVI of the Rules which makes provision for the imposition of various punishments including dismissal from the police force.

(i) or cl. (ii) at any time. and in the case of a tenant falling within Cl. (iii) within a period of one year from the date of commencement of this Act.

Teja, the landlord was a large land owner under whom there were three tenants. Each o them applied for purchase of ownership under section 18(1) of the Act. The Assistant Collector found them eligible, fixed the price and the instalments of payment, and they duly deposited the first instalment. After this Teja died. Before the Financial Commissioner, the appellants contended that on the death of Teja, they as the heirs of 'Teja, became entitled to shares and, in this process of fragmentation, they became small landowners within the meaning of section 2(2) of the Act and therefore the tenants will be disentitled to purchase the land. Their plea was that an appeal is a continuation of the original proceeding and, therefore is there is a change of circumstances in the landlord 's ownership during the pendency of the appeal, resulting in his legal representatives becoming small landowners ' the tenants will be disentitled to purchase the land.

Had the scheme of agrarian reform in the Punjab been simple and had the virtue of early finality so necessary in such a measure been present, the law would have operated with speed and changed the rural landscape radically, instead of provoking a heavy run of never ending litigation.

These lands though cul tivable were not cultivated for a continuous period of 3 years prior to the coming into Iorce of the Bombay Taluqdari Tenure Abolition Act, 1949. In the tenant 's appeal to this Court, on the question whether these lands were uncultivated lands within the meaning of Section 6 of the 1949 Act and thus became vested in the State: Dismissing the appeals, this Court, HELD: 1. The lands in question are clearly covered by the definition of the expression \"uncultivated land\" as set out in the Explanation to Section 6 of the Bombay Taluqdari Tenure Abolition Act, 1949. [500 F]. 1.1 Even according to the appellants themselves, the lands were under cultivation for some time prior to the coming into force of the said Act and hence it could not be said that they were uncultivable lands. They were in fact lands which were capable of cultivation and as a matter of fact had been subjected to cultivation for some time but were not cultivated 1or continuous period of three years prior to the coming into force of the Act. Accordingly the lands must be regarded as \"uncultivated lands\" for the purposes of Section 6 of the Act and must be deemed to be vested in the State Government. [500 E F, 499 C].

The appellants were the tenants of certain lands which form part of the estate or wanta of a Taluqsdar. Under the provisions of section 6, all uncultivated lands excluding the land used for building and other non agricultural purposes were not situate within the limits of the wantas as belonging to a taluqidar in a taluv dari estate.

            "Target: Section 13 of the Karnataka Municipalities Act, 1964, provides that for the purpose of election of councillors of a town municipality at a general election the State Government shall, after previous publication by notification, determine, (a) the number of territorial divisions into which the municipality shall be divided. (b) the extent of each territorial division; (c) the number of seats allotted to each territorial division. and (d) the number of seats reserved for the Scheduled Castes and women. Section 14 provides that the electoral roll of the State Legislative Assembly for the territorial area comprised in the division, shall be deemed to be the list of voters of such division Rule 75 of the Mysore Municipalities (Election of Councillors) Rules, 196 empowers the State Government to make such orders as it deems fit for ensuring that the elections are held in accordance with the provisions of the Act. For holding a general election with respect to a town municipal council, the State Government issued the notification under section 13. Thereafter the Returning officer issued a notice fixing the calendar of events for holding the election. The list of voters for each division was prepared exactly according to the Electoral Roll, and kept open for inspection In the office of the municipal council. A list of the contesting candidates was also published and the poll date was also fixed as January 10, 1975. At that state it was found that some voters residing in the border of one division had been included in the voters ' list of an adjoining division and the State Government, in purported exercise of the power under r. 75, cancelled the calendar of events published by the Returning officer and directed a fresh preparation of the voters ' list as per the divisions notified. In a writ petition filed by the respondents, who were residents of the town, the High Court held that the State Government had no power to cancel the calendar of events and quashed the direction of the State Government. Dismissing the appeal to this Court, ^ HELD: (1) What is required by section 14(1) is that the list of voters of a division should correspond ipsissima verba with the Electoral Roll for the territorial area included in the division. of there is any mistake in the Electoral Roll in the some voters residing in one area or house number are shown as residing in another, it cannot be corrected by the Returning officer while preparing the list of voters for that division. The only way in which such mistake can be corrected is by applying for rectification of the Electoral Roll under section 22 of the Representation of the People Act, 1950, but of such rectification is not made the entries in the Electoral Roll would stand and they would necessarily be reflected in the list of voters for the division. But that would not constitute a mistake so far as the preparation of the list of voters for the division is concerned. It is only if the list of voters for the division does not correspond\" with the concerned Electoral Roll in the sense that the voters shown in the Electoral Roll as residing in the territorial are omitted to be included in the list of voters of that division or voters shown In the Electoral Roll as residing in the territorial area of one division are included in the list of voters of another. that it can be said that the List is defective and not in accordance with the provisions of the Act [64D H] 58 (2) The scheme of the Act and particularly sections 14 and 15 show that it is only one list of voters that is contemplated to be in force during the entire process of election, and there is no question of correcting the list of voters according to the revised Electoral Roll which had come into being in February, 1975. [65G H] The list of voters is to be prepared for the election tnd 'election ' means the entire process consisting of the several stages and embracing the several steps by which an elected member is returned. [65H] Section 14(1) does not contemplate a list of voters which keeps on changing from time to time during the election process. It deems the Electoral Roll for the territorial area of the division in force at the relevant time to be the list of voters for the division for the purposes of the Act that is, for the purposes of the 'election '. Section 14(3) enacts that every person whose name is in the list of voters referred to in sub section (1) shall be qualified to vote at the election of a member for the division to which such list pertains. Section 15 (2) also says that the list of voters shall be conclusive evidence for the purpose of determining under this section whether the person is qualified or not qualified to vote or to be elected. The sub sections refer to the same list of voters and it is, therefore, clear that the legislature did not intend that the list of voters should change from time to time during the process of election and the relevant Electoral Roll for the purpose of preparation of the list of voters must consequently be taken to be the Electoral Roll in force at the date when the election process commenced, that is when the calendar of events was published.

Ponnuswami vs Returning officer, Namakkal Constituency & Ors, ; , followed Shivappa Chanamallappa jogendra vs Basavannappa Gadlappa Bankar, [1965] Mysore L.J. 289. approved. Obiter: Till the election process has commenced by the issue of a notice fixing the calendar of events. there is no reason why the designed officer should not be entitled to rectify the list of voters for a division if it can be shown that the list of voters does not correspond exactly with the Electoral Roll for the territorial area and bring the list of voters in conformity with the Electoral Roll, but once the calendar of events is published and the election process has begun it is extremely doubtful whether any changes can be made in the list of voters for the purpose of setting right any such defect.

            "Prediction: Gangawati Municipality was divided into six territorial divisions and each territorial division was defined and demarcated by reference to census block numbers, wards and also boundaries. The Returning Officer there after on 7th December, 1974 issued a notice fixing the calendar of events for holding the election. Angered and frustrated by this second attempt on the part of the State Government to bulk the holding of the election, the same individual preferred another writ petition, namely, Writ Petition No. 2715 of 1974. The High Court made an order on this writ petition directing the Government to hold the election within four months. The State Government thereafter, in accordance with the undertaking given by it, appointed the Administrator to exercise the powers and perform and discharge the functions and duties of the Town Municipal Council and also constituted an Advisory Council to advise and assist the Administrator.

            "Target: The appellants were convicted for offences under sections 302,394 and 34 IPC. They were alleged to have entered the house of the deceased at midnight and attacked him and his wife, PW 14, with sharp edged weapons. He sustained fatal injuries and died instantaneously. His wife was injured. Their two sons ran to the house of uncle PW 1, at a distance to inform him of the incident. They had not seen the assail ants. By the time PW 1 reached the scene the assailants had fled. He had been in the house the whole night and contacted all the concerned persons. In the FIR that he lodged at about 10 a.m. the next morning the assailants were not named. The prosecution case was that the appellants had commit ted the crime on account of enmity. PW 14, who claimed to be an eye witness, deposed that she had identified the appel lants. She also stated that she became unconscious and regained consciousness only the next day when the police arrived. PW 1 supported her version. The trial court accepted the testimony of PW 14. The High Court agreed with it. In this appeal by special leave, it was contended for the appellants that if PW 14 had identified the assailants, it would have been possible for PW 1 to disclose the identi ty of the accused at the time the first information report was lodged, and that the prosecution had introduced the theory of unconsciousness of PW 14 only in an attempt to explain away the lacuna Allowing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1. It is not safe to sustain the conviction when there is 573 reasonable doubt regarding the participation of the appel lants in the crime. The benefit of doubt must necessarily go to them. The statement of PW 1 at the earliest point of time belies the truth of what he had deposed before the court. He had been categoric in the FIR that he had made enquiries with the wife and sons of the deceased before proceeding to the police station and asserted that five or six unknown persons had committed the crime. He had also stated that details could be furnished by the widow and sons of the deceased. This affirmed that he could not gather any useful information regarding identity of the assailants. All the same, in cross examination he supported the version of PW 14 that she was lying unconscious when he reached the house at night and she narrated the incident after regaining con sciousness when the police reached there. It clearly indi cates that an attempt had been made by the prosecution to introduce the case of unconsciousness of PW 14 to explain the infirmity. [576F; G] 3. The circumstance that the identity of the assailants was unknown until the police arrived at the scene showed that PW 14 or her children had not identified the assailants at the time of the occurrence. The courts below have failed to appreciate her evidence in the correct perspective in the light of the clinching evidence. [576B] \n",

            "Target: The petitioner who was detained under the Preventive Detention Act (Act IV of 1950) applied under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus and for his release from detention, on the ground that the said Act contravened the provisions of articles 13, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitu tion and was consequently ultra rites and that his detention was therefore illegal: Held, per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI and MAHAJAN JJ. dissentinq) that the preventive Detention Act, 1950, with the exception of Sec. 14 thereof did not contravene any of the Articles of the Constitution and even though Sec. 14 was ultra rites inas much as it contravened the provisions of article 9.9, (5) of the Constitution, as this section was severable from the remaining sections of the Act, the invalidity of Sec. 14 did not affect the validity of the Act as a whole, and the detention of the petitioner was not illegal. FAZL ALl and MAHAJAN JJ. Section 12, of the Act was also ultra vires, and since it contravened the very provi sion in the 89 Constitution under which the Parliament derived its compe tence to enact the law, the detention was illegal. Held, by the Full Court (KANIA CJ., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.) Section 14 of the , contravenes the provisions of article 9.9. (5) of the Constitution in so far as it prohibits a person detained from disclosing to the Court the grounds on which a detention order has been made or the representation made by him against the order of detention, and is to that extent ultra vires and void. Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI J. dissenting). Article 19 of the Consti tution has no application to a law which relates directly to preventive detention even though as a result of an order of detention the rights referred to in sub cls. (a) to (e) and (g) in general, and sub cl. (d) in particular, of cl. (1) of article 19 may be restricted or abridged; and the constitution al validity of a law relating to such detention cannot therefore, be judged in the light of the test prescribed in el. (5) of the said Article. DAS J. Article 19 (1) postulates a legal capacity to exercise the rights guaranteed by it and if a citizen loses the freedom of his person by reason of lawful detention as a result of a conviction for an offence or otherwise he cannot claim the right s under sub cls. (a) to (e) and (g) of article 19 (1); likewise if a citizen 's property is compulsorily ac quired under article 31, he cannot claim the right under sub el. (f) of article 19 (1) with respect to that property. In short the rights under sub cls. (a) to (e) and (g) end where lawful detention begins and therefore the validity of a preventive detention Act cannot be judged by Arc. 19 (5). MAHAJAN J. Whatever be the precise scope of article 19 (1) (d) and Art.19(5) the provisions of article 19(5) do not apply to a law relating to preventive detention, inasmuch as 'there is a special self contained provision in article 22 regulating it. FAZL ALI.J. Preventive detention is a direct infringe ment of the right guaranteed in article 19 (1) (d), even if a narrow construction is placed on the said sub clause, and a law relating to preventive detention is therefore subject to such limited judicial review as is permitted by article 19 (5). Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALl J. dissenting). The concept of the right \"to move freely throughout the territory of India\" referred to in article 19 (1) (d), of the Constitution is entirely differ ent from the concept of the right to \"personal liberty\" referred to in article 21, and article 19 should not, therefore, be read as controlled by the provisions of article 21. The view that article 19 guarantees substantive rights and article 21 prescribes the procedure is incorrect. DAs J. Article 19 protects some of the important attributes of personal liber ty as independent rights and the expression \"personal liber ty\" is used in article 21 as a compendious term 90 including within Rs meaning all varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of men. FAZL ALl J. Even if it be assumed that article 19 (1) (d) does not refer to \" personal liberty\" and that it bears the restricted meaning attributed to it,that is to say, R signi fies merely the right to move from one locality to another, preventive detention must be held to affect this limited right of movement directly and substantially. One of the objects of preventive detention is to restrain a person detained from moving from place to place so that he may not spread disaffection or indulge in dangerous activities in the places he visits. The same consideration applies to the cases of persons who are interned or externed. Hence, externment, interment and certain other forms of restriction on movement have always been treated as kindred matters belonging to the same group or family, and the rule which applies to one must necessarily apply to the others. Per KANIA C. J ,, PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS 35. (MAHAJAN 3. dissenting). Article 22 does not form a complete code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention. To the extent that provision is made in article 9.9, it cannot be controlled by article 9,1; but on points of procedure which expressly or by necessary implication are not dealt with by article 22, article 9.1 will apply. DAS J. article 21 protects substantive rights by requiring a procedure and article 9.9. lays down the minimum rules of procedure that even the Parliament cannot abrogate or overlook. MAHAJAN J. article 99. contains a self contained code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention and cannot be examined or controlled by the provisions of article 21. The principles underlying article 21 are however kept in view in article 22 and there is no conflict between these articles. MUKHERJEA J. Even assuming that article 22 is not a self contained code relating to preventive detention and that article 21 would apply, it is .not permissible to supplement article 22 by the application of rules of natural justice. FAZL ALI J. article 22. does not form an exhaustive code by itself relating to preventive detention. Parliament can make further provi sions and if it has done so article 19 (5) may be applied to see if those provisions have transgressed the bounds of reasonableness. Per KANIA C.J., MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI J. dis senting). In article 9.1 the word 'law\" has been used in the sense of State made law and not as an equivalent of law in the abstract or general sense embodying the principles of natural justice; and \"procedure established by law\" means procedure established by law made by the State, that is to say, the Union Parliament or the Legislatures of the States. It is not proper to construe this expression in the light of the meaning given to.the expression \"due process of law\" in the American Constitution by the Supreme Court of America. FATANJALI SASTRI cl. \"Law\" in article 21 does not mean the jus naturale of civil law but means 91 positive or State made law. \"Procedure established by law\" does not however mean any procedure which may be prescribed by a competent legislature, but the ordinary well estab lished criminal procedure, i.e., those settled. usages and normal modes of procedure sanctioned by the Criminal Proce dure Code, which is the general law of criminal proce dure in this country. The only alternative to this con struction, if a constitutional transgression is to be avoid ed is to interpret the reference to \"law\" as implying a constitutional 'amendment pro tanto, for it is only a law enacted by the procedure provided for such amendment that could modify or override a fundamental right without contra vening article 13 (2). FAZL, ALI J. There is nothing revolutionary in the view that \"procedure established by law \"must include the four principles of elementary justice which inhere in and are at the root of all civilized systems of law, and which have been stated by the American Courts and jurists as consisting in (1) notice, (2) opportunity to be heard, (3) impartial tribunal and (4) orderly course of procedure. These four principles are really different aspects of the same right, namely, the right to be heard before one is condemned. Hence the words \"procedure established by law \", whatever its exact meaning be, must necessarily include the principle that no person shall be condemned without hearing by an impartial tribunal. Per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN and DAS JJ. Section 3 of the , does not delegate any legislative power to an executive officer but merely confers on such officer a discretion to enforce the law made by the legislature, and is not there fore invalid on this ground. The fact that the section does not provide an objective standard for determining whether the requirements of law have been complied with, is not a ground for holding that it is invalid. FAZL ALI J. Section 3 is however a reasonable provision only for the first step, i.e., for arrest and initial detention and must be followed by some procedure for testing the so called subjective satisfaction, which can be done only by providing a suitable machinery for examining the grounds on which the order of detention is made and considering the representations of the persons detained in relation to those grounds. Per KANIA C. J., MAHAJAN and DAS JJ. Section 7 of the said Act is not invalid merely because it does not provide for an oral hearing or an opportunity to lead evidence but only gives right to make a representation. Right to an oral hearing and right to give evidence are not necessarily implied in the right to make a representation given by article 22. Per KANIA C.J., and MAHAJAN J. The provision contained in Sec. 11 that a person may be detained for such period as the 12 A 92 State thinks fit does not contravene article 22 (7) and it is not therefore invalid. Per KANIA. C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI and MAHAJAN JJ. dissenting). Article 22 (7) means that Parliament may prescribe either the circumstances under which, or the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without reference to an advisory board. It is not necessary that the Parliament should prescribe both. The matters referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub see. (1) of Sec. 12 constitute a sufficient description of such circumstances or classes of cases and Section 12 is not therefore open to the objection that it does not comply with article 22 (7) DAS J. Parliament has in act and substance prescribed both in clauses (a) and (b) of sub sec. (1) of Sec. 12. FAZL ALI and MAJAN JJ. Article 22 (7) Means that both the circumstances and the class or classes of cases (which are two different expressions with different meanings and connotations) should be prescribed, and the prescription of one without the other will not be enough. The enumeration of the subjects for reasons connected with which a law of preventive detention could be made contained in els. (a) and (b) of sub see. (1) of Sec.12 does not amount to prescribing the circumstances under which, or the class or classes of cases in which, a person can be detained for more than three months. Per KANIA C.J. While it is not proper to take into consideration the individual opinions of members of Parlia ment or Convention to construe the meaning of a particular clause, when a question is raised whether a certain phrase or expression was up for consideration at all or not, a reference to the debates may be permitted. PATANJAYLI SASTRI J. In construing the provisions of an Act, speeches made in the course of the debates on the bill should not be taken into consideration. MUKHERJEA J. In construing the Constitution it is better to leave out of account the debates in the Constituent Assembly, but a higher value may be placed on the report of the Drafting Committee. \n",

            "Target: This appeal raises the question of how the concepts of sufficiency and infringement are to be applied to a Swiss form patent relating to a specified medical use of a known pharmaceutical compound. The Appellant (Warner Lambert) is part of the Pfizer group of companies. It is the proprietor of European Patent No 0641330 for Isobutylgaba. This is used for the treatment of seizure disorders, including epilepsy. Pregabalin, a derivative compound of Isobutylgaba, is marketed by Warner Lambert under the Lyrica brand. Patent No 0641330 expired on 17 May 2013. This appeal concerns a second European Patent No EP(UK) 0934061 entitled Isobutylgaba and its derivatives for the treatment of pain, with a priority date of 24 July 1996 (the Patent). The claims of the Patent (which define the scope of the patent protection) are all purpose limited. Most relevant are Claims 1 3 on the use of pregabalin for treating (1) pain, (2) inflammatory pain and (3) neuropathic pain. Lyrica has marketing authorisation in the EU for treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain, epilepsy and generalised anxiety disorder. It is one of Pfizers most successful drugs in the UK. The First Respondent (Mylan) and the Second Respondent, Actavis Group PTC EHF (Actavis), are pharmaceutical companies mainly engaged in marketing generic pharmaceutical products. Actavis markets a generic pregabalin product under the brand name Lecaent, launched in 2015. In these proceedings, Mylan and Actavis claimed the revocation of the Patent on the grounds of lack of inventive step and insufficiency. Warner Lambert claim that Actavis infringes Claims 1 and 3 above. At first instance, Arnold J rejected the arguments based on lack of inventive step. These are no longer in issue. Further, he held that Claim 1 (pain) and Claim 3 (neuropathic pain) were invalid because he construed Claim 1 as extending to all pain and Claim 3 as extending to all neuropathic pain. He found that there was sufficient disclosure in the specification to support the claim that pregabalin was efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory and peripheral neuropathic pain, but not central neuropathic pain. Both claims therefore failed for insufficiency. The result of the judges decision was to remove patent protection for the manufacture of pregabalin for the treatment of both peripheral and central neuropathic pain. Arnold J also rejected as an abuse of process an application concerning an amendment to narrow the Patent. The Court of Appeal (Floyd, Kitchin and Patten LJJ) upheld the judges findings, so far as relevant to this appeal, and his decision on the amendment application. The judge and Court of Appeal differed in their approach to infringement in patent cases confined to manufacture for a particular use. On appeal to the Supreme Court, Warner Lambert contend that all the claims of the Patent were valid. Their main aim is to establish the validity of their claims relating to neuropathic pain or, at least, peripheral neuropathic pain. Actavis and Mylan cross appeal, arguing that none of the claims as to neuropathic pain are valid. They only accept as valid the claims limited to inflammatory pain, for which there is no marketing authorisation. This gives rise to four issues on appeal: (i) the construction of the claims (in particular, Claim 3 as to neuropathic pain); (ii) the sufficiency of the disclosure in the specification; (iii) amendment and abuse of process; and (iv) the test for infringement of a patent in relation to manufacturing for a limited use. The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal and allows the cross appeal (Lord Mance and Lord Hodge dissenting in part on whether there was sufficient disclosure in the specification for Claims 1 and 3). Lord Sumption gives the leading judgment, with which Lord Reed, Lord Hodge and Lord Briggs agree, save on some issues specified in the separate judgments of Lord Briggs, Lord Hodge and Lord Mance. Issues (i) and (iii) Construction of the claims and amendment/abuse of process: The court unanimously affirms (for reasons given by Lord Briggs): (1) the view of both courts that Claim 1 extends to all pain and Claim 3 to all neuropathic pain, whether peripheral or central, and (2) Arnold Js decision rejecting Warner Lamberts application to amend the Patent to narrow it [15(1), 16 (Lord Sumption); 99 106, 118 120 (Lord Briggs); 181 (Lord Hodge); 195 196 (Lord Mance)]. Issue (ii) Sufficiency of disclosure in specification for Claims 1 and 3: The court holds, by a majority (Lord Sumption, Lord Reed and Lord Briggs), that the disclosure in the specification supports the claims in relation to inflammatory pain, but not neuropathic pain, whether peripheral or central. Claims 1 and 3 therefore fail for insufficiency. Thus, the appeal is dismissed and the cross appeal allowed [15(2), 43 54]. The majoritys approach requires the patentee to demonstrate that the specification discloses some scientific reason why the implied assertion of efficacy in the patent claim may well be true [36 37]. More than a bare assertion or mere possibility of therapeutic efficiency is required, though a priori reasoning (not necessarily only experimental data) may suffice [37]. This respects the principle that the patentee cannot claim a monopoly of new use for an existing compound without real disclosure [35]. Lord Hodge (dissenting) proposes an alternative approach to sufficiency, preferring a lower standard of plausibility, and would have dismissed the cross appeal [186 190]. Lord Mance agrees with Lord Hodge on this issue, concluding that the majoritys approach imposes too high a threshold [198 201]. Issue (iv) Correct test for infringement of patent manufactured for a limited use: The court unanimously holds that if Claims 1 and 3 had been valid, they would not have been infringed by Actavis [15(3)]. The reasons for arriving at this agreed result differ substantially. Lord Sumption and Lord Reed consider that the intention of the alleged infringer, whether subjective or objective, is irrelevant and that the sole criterion of infringement is whether the product as it emerges from the manufacturing process, including any labelling or accompanying leaflet, is presented as suitable for the uses which enjoy patent protection the outward presentation test [15(3), 71 86]. On the facts of this case, it is not disputed that Lecaent was sold with labels and patient information to the effect that it was for the treatment of seizure disorders and general anxiety disorder [8, 15(3)]. Lord Mance agrees that the test depends on the objective appearance and characteristics of the product as it is prepared, presented and put on the market, but considers that in rare cases the context may make it obvious that these are not to be taken at face value [15(3); 218 223].

            "Prediction: The Swiss Federal Intellectual Property Office issued a statement of practice that it would be prepared to grant patents for second use medical patents in the following form: the use of compound X in the manufacture of a medicament for a specified new and inventive therapeutic application, even in a case in which the process of manufacture as such does not differ from known processes using the same active ingredient. Swiss form patents were not product patents, but purpose limited process patents. They surmounted both obstacles because the invention is identified as neither a product nor a method of treatment but a manufacturing process for a novel purpose. This development responded to a real problem, namely the difficulty of obtaining patent protection for second uses that may have been truly inventive and involved costly research.

            "Target: Respondent No. 1 who was functioning at the relevant time as the commissioner of Archives and Historical Research, Tamil Nadu, delivered a speech at a function held by the History Association of the Presidency College, Madras criticising the time capsule buried in the precincts of the Red Fort at Delhi which led to a furore both in Parliament as well as in the national press. The Government, feeling greatly embarrassed by the controversy, started a disciplinary inquiry against him on the view that being a civil servant it was not desirable that he should have participated in a public discussion on the time capsule but later on dropped the same. However, just a day before that, a signed news item appeared in a newspaper about the controversy regarding the time capsule stating that a Government spokesman had charged respondent No. 1 as trying to 'sabotage the civil services from within '. Having failed in his efforts to ascertain from the Government the identity of its spokesman who had made this offending utterance against him or to induce it to issue a contradiction through the Press, respondent No. 1 addressed a letter to the correspondent of the newspaper asking him to disclose the name of the Government spokesman. The correspondent, in his reply, stated that the Government spokesman was respondent No. 2, the Chief Secretary to the Government, who, during a telephonic conversation with him, had made the offending utterance. Respondent No. 1 made a representation to the Government with regard to his grievance in this behalf but, finding that there was no response, applied for sanction of the Government under r. 17 of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 seeking permission to institute a suit against respondent No. 2 for damages for defamation. The Government refused to grant the permission and respondent No. 1 moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution against the order of refusal. The writ petition was dismissed by a Single Judge, who inter alia in his judgment referred to a concession made by the Advocate 491 General appearing for the appellants that the act complained of was an official act and, therefore, the intended suit was to vindicate an official act which was the subject matter of a defamatory criticism. Respondent No. 1 preferred an appeal under cl. 15 of the Letters Patent and a Division Bench allowed the appeal holding that the refusal of the State Government to grant the requisite permission under r. 17 could not be justified on the ground of public interest. B Allowing the appeals, ^ HELD: According to its plain terms, r. 17 of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968 is in the nature of a restraint on a member of the All India Services from bringing a suit for damages for defamation for an act done in the exercise of his official duties as a public servant or from going to the press in vindication of his official act or character. Explanation to r. 17 seeks to restrict the scope and effect of the restraint placed by r. 17. No member of the Service is prohibited from vindicating his private character or any act done by him in his private capacity. Proviso thereto however casts on him a duty to report to the Government regarding such action. [497B c l In the instant case, respondent No. 1 made a speech incidentally at a time when he was holding the post of the commissioner of Archives & Historical Research, at a function organised by the History Association of the Presidency College, Madras. He was invited to make a speech on the occasion presumably for his attainments, in the field. But the speech delivered by him on the occasion could not be treated to be an official act of his and therefore the suit brought by him against respondent No. 2, the then Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu could not be treated to be a suit for the vindication of his official act. It is common knowledge that persons of erudition and eminence are often times asked to grace such occasions or make a speech and when they do so, undoubtedly they give expression to their personal views on various subjects. By no stretch of imagination can it be said that while doing so they act in the discharge of their official duties merely because they happen to hold public office. [499A D] During the course of his judgment, the learned Single Judge adverts to paragraph 17 of the writ petition where respondent No. 1 has averred that his intended suit was to vindicate his private character and not to vindicate any official act. The case of respondent No. 1 therefore throughout has been that r. 17 of the Rules was not attracted to the suit and indeed he specifically aver that he was entitled to file a suit even 492 without the permission of the Government under r. 17. However, he goes on to say that if a suit were to be filed it might land him into trouble in that disciplinary proceedings might be taken against him for having instituted a suit without previous permission of the Government. On the assumption that such sanction was necessary under r. 17, he moved the High Court for grant of an appropriate writ under article 226 of the Constitution, apparently by way of ex abundanti cautela. The learned Single Judge did not deal with the scope and ambit of r. 17 in view of the concession made by the learned Advocate General. We have no manner of doubt that the appellants are not bound by the concession made by the learned Advocate General before the learned Single Judge that the act complained of was an official act. It is unfortunate that the State Government was not properly advised at the earlier stages of the proceedings in insisting upon the view that such permission was required under r. 17 and that it was justified in refusing to grant the permission prayed for. The concession made by the learned Advocate General being on a matter of law is not binding. [498D G] \n",

In the appeal by certificate to this Court, it was contended on behalf of the Appellant that long before passing of the order and even before sugar was declared to be an essential commodity, the appellant had completely stopped the running of the Mill with no intention to start it again, there was, therefore, no undertaking within the meaning of Rule 125A and the order passed under Rule 125A which was not attracted must be held to be bad and invalid. On behalf of the Union of India, it was contended that Rule 125A confers jurisdiction and authority to pass an order even in respect of an undertaking closed and intended to be permanently shut down. Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD : The taking over of the management of the sugar mill of the appellant and the appointment of the authorised controller were perfectly valid and lawful and the act done by the authorised controller in the course of management is binding on the appellant.

The provision in Rule 125A that \"in this rule unless the context otherwise requires, an 'undertaking ' means any undertaking (including an undertaking vested in or controlled or managed by, a local authority) which is engaged in \", is merely descriptive of the undertaking to which this rule is applicable. The words \"which is engaged in the production\" merely describes the kind of undertaking by referring to the nature of the activity of the undertaking for bringing it within the purview of Rule 125A and they have no bearing on the question whether the activities are in the process of being carried on or have been stopped.

It was also contended for some of the petitioners who were assignees of land revenue as also owners of land that, under the Act, an intermediary included a jagir and that as a jagirdar was merely an assignee of land revenue, only that assignment could be said to have been acquired under the Act. Held, (1) that the purposes for which the estates were acquired were purposes of the State of Ajmer and, consequently, the Act was within the competency of the Ajmer legislature as it fell within entry 36 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, and it was not necessary to consider where the property should vest after acquisition in deciding the ambit of the competence of the legislature under the entry ; (2) that the provisions in section 8 of the Act which gave power to the Collector to cancel leases which were found to have been made in anticipation of legislation for abolition of intermediaries and which were, consequently, a fraud upon the Act, subserve the purposes of the Act and would, therefore, be an integral part of the Act, though ancillary to its main object, and were protected under article 31 A(1)(a) of the Constitution ; (3)that the intention of the Act was that the intermediaries who were allotted lands should cultivate them personally and the object of section 38 was to discourage them from letting the land and becoming a new kind of intermediaries, and, consequently, the section being an ancillary provision necessary for the purposes of carrying out the objects of the Act, was protected under article 31 A(1)(a) of the Constitution; and (4)that in view of the origin of the title of the holders of these estates who were called jagirdars, a distinction could not be made between jagirdars as assignees of land revenue and the same persons as land owners, and therefore, the State could take over the entire interest in the estate under section 4 Of the Act. \n",

The High Court dismissed the petition and also dismissed an application made by the petitioner for amendment of the petition to include a new allegation on the ground that it was made after the expiry of the period prescribed for filing an election petition. On appeal to this Court, HELD : Dismissing the appeal : (i) The High Court had rightly held that it could not exercise its power to permit amendment of a petition so as to allow new grounds or char es to be raised or the character of the petition to be so altered as to make it in substance a new petition, if a fresh petition on those allegations would be barred on the date of the proposed amendment.

Expenses incurred by any other agent or person without anything more need not be included in the account or return, as such incurring of expenditure would be purely voluntary.

            "Target: The Madhya Bharat Municipalities Act 1954 came into force January 26, 1954. The Indore City Municipal Act, 1909 which had till then governed the Indore Municipality was thereby repealed. Under the repealed Act the Indore Municipality used to levy and collect house tax at the rate of 7% of the gross annual letting value. Under section 73(2) of the 1954 Act house tax was to be assessed on the basis of the gross annual letting value less 10% statutory allowance for repairs etc. However, even for the period after the passing of the new Act, the Municipal Corporation, purporting to act under section 79 '(1) of the 1954 Act. adopted ,the latest assessment list prepared under the old Act and levied house tax at the old rate of 7% of the gross. annual letting value. The respondents who were trustees of certain house property filed a suit challenging the levy on the basis of the gross annual letting value when section 73(2) of the 1954 Act required the tax to be assessed on the net value after deduction of the statutory allowance. The suit was decreed by the 'Trial Court and the appeals filed by the Corporation before the District judge and the High Court were dismissed. The Corporation by special leave, came to this Court and urged: (i) that the levy at 7% of the gross annual letting value prescribed under the rules of the Indore Act was saved by section 2(c) of the 1954 Act; (ii) that under section 79(1) the Corporation was required to prepare a fresh assessment list only once in four years, that it was therefore entitled to adopt for the years in question the latest assessment list prepared under the old Act. and the said assessment list having been so adopted was conclusive evidence as to the annual rental value of houses and the house tax imposed thereon. HELD: (i) While section 2(c) saves the rules and taxes. imposed under the old Act it saves them only to the extent that they are consistent with the new Act. The saving and deeming provisions of section 2(c) can only apply if the tax is assessed in the manner consistent with the provisions of section 73, that is, if it is assessed on the net and not the gross annual letting value after deducting 10% statutory allowance. The Corporation could not be allowed to go on imposing the tax on the basis of the gross annual letting value for ever despite the express provision in section 73. The tax imposed by the Corporation at the rate of 7% of the gross annual letting value was not therefore saved by section 2(c). [129E H] (ii) Ordinarily the Municipal Corporation has to prepare a fresh assessment list every year. The legislature has however by section 79(1) empowered the Corporation to adopt the valuation and assessment contained in the assessment list prepared in an earlier year provided, however, that it prepares a fresh list once in every 4 years. But sub section (2) 126 of section 79 provides expressly that when such a previous list is adopted for a particular official year it can be done subject to the provisions sections 75 and 76. The list so adopted has therefore to be published, has to invite objections and has to be authenticated in the manner prescribed by section 76(6) after disposing of the objections if any and it is then only that it becomes conclusive evidence of the valuation and the tax assessed thereon for that particular official year. If it were otherwise a house owner would have no opportunity to object to the assessment for four years even though the value of his house may have decreased for some reason or the other. Section 79 has therefore to be construed to mean that though a Municipality need not prepare a fresh assessment list every year and need prepare such list once in every 4 ),ears and can adopt an earlier assessment list such an adopted list becomes the assessment list for that particular year as if it was a new list and to which sections 75 and 76 apply. [130E 131C] Accordingly, the Corporation was entitled to adopt for the official years in question the latest list prepared under the old Act, and under section 79 that list would become the assessment list for the said years provided that the provisions of sections 75 and 76 are followed. Even then the appellant Corporation would not be. entitled to impose house tax on the basis of the gross annual letting value as such imposition would be inconsistent with section 73 under which the annual letting value would be the gross annual letting value less 10% statutory allowance. [131D] Even on the footing that the resolution passed by the Indore Municipality to levy the tax at 7% of the gross annual letting value and on the basis of which the last list under the ,old Act was prepared was saved and was deemed to have been made under the 1954 Act it could be deemed to have been so made in so far as it was consistent with the provisions of the Act. Therefore to the extent that it was inconsistent with section 73 it was neither saved nor deemed to have been made under the Act and had to be adjusted in the light of the provisions of section 73(2).

            "Target: Respondent Ram Ratan was employed as a Forest Guard in the Forest Department of Madhya Pradesh Government. He was served with a charge sheet dated March 6, 1969, in which he was accused of misconduct. Respondent refuted the charges. A departmental enquiry was held by the Divisional Forest Officer, Mr. Mathotra, in respect of the charges framed against the respondent. Charge of misconduct was held proved whereupon the punishing authority served respondent with a second show cause notice dated February 12, 1970, as contemplated by Article 311(2) of the Constitution as it stood prior to its amendment in 1976. After the respondent replied to the notice the disciplinary cum punishing authority imposed the penalty of compulsory retirement on the respondent. The respondent questioned the validity and correctness of the punishment in Civil Suit No. 227 A/73 filed by him in the Court of the Civil Judge, Civil Court, Class II, Sabalgarh. The trial Court decreed the suit and set aside the order imposing the major penalty of compulsory retirement and granted a declaration that respondent continues in service. On appeal by the State of Madhya Pradesh, the Second Additional District Judge, Morena, set aside the decree of the trial Court and dismissed the suit of the respondent. On appeal by the respondent to the High Court a learned single judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court a allowed the appeal of respondent and set aside the decree made by the District Judge and restored the one passed by the trial Court with the result that a declaration was granted that the respondent would continue in service till the date of his superannuation. Hence this appeal by special leave by the State of Madhya Pradesh. Allowing the appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1. Article 311(2) as it stood at the relevant time prior to its amendment in 1976 imposed a constitutional obligation upon the punishing authority to serve a second show cause notice where it was proposed after departmental inquiry to impose on the delinquent Government servant any of the 1244 penalties referred to in article 311 so as to give a reasonable opportunity of making representation on the penalty proposed. Rule 15(4)(i)(b) of the 1966 Rules prescribes procedure to be followed by the disciplinary authority before imposing punishment to the effect that the concerned authority should give a notice setting out the penalty proposed to be imposed on the concerned government servant, and calling upon him to submit within 15 days of the receipt of notice or such further time not exceeding 15 days, as may be allowed, such representation as he may wish to make on the proposed penalty on the basis of the evidence adduced during the inquiry held under rule 14. The punishing authority has in the second show cause notice to specify the punishment which it tentatively or provisionally decides upon to impose looking to the gravity of the charge which is held proved. At that stage the decision of the punishing authority is a tentative decision and in the very nature of things it must be so because an opportunity has to be given to the delinquent government servant to make a representation on the nature of penalty. This would imply that if the delinquent officer in his representation makes out a case for a lesser punishment the disciplinary authority would keep an open mind and after applying its mind to the representation made by the delinquent government servant, the authority may either confirm its earlier tentative decision or it would be open to it to award a lesser penalty then the one tentatively decided.

Principle of natural justice and fair play implicit in article 311(2) and rule 15(4)(i)(b) would require that the disciplinary authority has to take into consideration the representation made by the delinquent government servant in response to the notice which is a constitutional obligation, and if the delinquent officer is in a position to pursuade by his representation, to so modulate the punishment as would accord with the gravity of the misconduct and other mitigating or extenuating circumstances all of which may enter into the verdict of deciding upon the penalty, and consequently the disciplinary authority would be free to impose a lesser penalty than the one proposed in the second notice. This is the constitutional scheme. [1248 A B] If the view, namely, that the disciplinary authority must tentatively decide upon the penalty and specify the penalty in the second show cause notice and after taking into consideration the representation made by the delinquent government servant in response to the notice it can only confirm the tentative decision but cannot award a lesser punishment, the exercise of giving second show cause notice becomes self defeating and giving of the notice inviting the representation on the question of penalty would be an exercise in futility. Such an approach would render a tentative decision as final and the rest being an empty formality. Such could not be the underlying object in enacting a constitutional mandate for the protection of government servants. [1248 C E] In service jurisprudence for different types of misconduct various penalties are prescribed in service rules. 1966 Rules prescribe as many as 9 penalties which can be awarded for good and sufficient reasons. Compulsory retirement is one of the major penalties. Similarly, removal from service which shall not be a disqualification for future appointment in government service and dismissal from service which shall ordinarily be a disqualification for future employment under the government are the other two major penalties. The disciplinary authority keeping in view the gravity of misconduct committed by the government servant will tentatively determine the penalty to be imposed upon the delinquent government servant. Degree of seriousness of misconduct will ordi 1245 narily determine the penalty keeping in view the degree of harm that each penalty can inflict upon the government servant. Before serving the second show cause notice the disciplinary authority will determine tentatively the penalty keeping in view the seriousness of misconduct. But this is a tentative decision. On receipt of representation in response to notice, the disciplinary authority will apply its mind to it, take into account any extenuating or mitigating circumstances pleaded in the representation and finally determine what should be the penalty that would be commensurate with the circumstances of the case. [1248 E H, 1249 A] It a major penalty was tentatively decided upon and a lesser or minor penalty cannot be awarded because this was not the specified penalty, the government servant to whom a notice proposing major penalty is served would run the risk of awarded major penalty because it would not be open to award a lesser or a minor penalty than the one specified in the show cause notice. Such a view runs counter to the principle of penology. In criminal and quasi criminal jurisprudence where the penalties are prescribed it is implicit thereunder that a major penalty would comprehend within its fold the minor penalty. If a major penalty is proposed looking to the circumstances of the case, at that stage, after taking into consideration the representation bearing on the subject and having an impact on the question of penalty a minor penalty can always be awarded. In penal statute maximum sentence for each offence is provided but the matter is within the discretion of the judicial officer awarding sentence to award such sentence within the ceiling prescribed by law as would be commensurate with the gravity of the offence and the surrounding circumstances except where minimum sentence is prescribed and Court 's discretion is by legislation fettered. [1299 A D] Therefore, if any particular penalty is specified as tentatively proposed in the second show cause notice the disciplinary authority after taking into consideration the representation made by the delinquent government servant can award that penalty or any lesser penalty and in so doing article 311(2) will not be violated. In fact, this leaves open a discretion to the punishing authority which accords with reason, fair play and justice.

Held, that the rule in Dattaka Mimansa against the adoption of the son of a woman who could not be married because of Viruddha Samandha relationship is recommendatory and even if the limitation of the orthodox Dattak adoption apply to Goda adoption there is no bar to the adoption of the wife 's sister 's husband.

            "Target: In Mohd. Hanif Quareshi vs The State of Bihar the Supreme Court held that a total ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and she buffaloes after they had ceased to be useful was not in the interests of the general public and was invalid. Thereafter, the Bihar Legislature passed the Bihar Preservation and Improvement of Animals (Amendment) Act, 1958, the Uttar Pradesh Legislature passed the U. P. Prevention of Cow Slaughter (Amendment) Act, 1958 and the Madhya Pradesh Legislature passed a new Act, the M. P. Agricultural Cattle Preservation Act, 1959. Section 3 of the Bihar Act prohibited the slaughter of a bull, bullock or she buffalo except when it was over 25 years of age and had become useless. Rule 3 of the Bihar Preservation and Improvement of Animals Rules, 1960 prescribed that the certificate for slaughtering an animal could be granted only with the concurrence of the Veterinary Officer and the Chairman or Chief Officer of a District Board, Municipality etc., and if the two differed, then according to the decision of the Sub Divisional Animal Husbandary Officer. Section 3 of the U. P. Act permitted the slaughter of a bull or bullock only if it was over 20 years of age and was permanently unfit. It further provided that the animal could not be slaughtered within 20 days of the grant of 'a certificate that it was fit to be slaughtered and gave a right of appeal to any person aggrieved by the order granting the certificate. Section 4(1)(b) of the Madhya Pradesh Act provided that no bull, bullock or buffallo could be slaughtered except upon a certificate issued by the competent authority and section 4(2)(a) provided that no certificate could be issued unless the animal was over 20 years of age and was unfit for work or breeding. Section 4(3) gave a right of appeal to any person aggrieved by the order of the competent authority. Section 5 provided that no animal 611 shall be slaughtered within 10 days of the date of the issue of the certificate and where an appeal was preferred against the grant of the certificate, till the time such appeal was disposed of. The petitioners, who carried on the profession and trade of butchers, contended that the various provisions of the three Acts set out above infringed their fundamental rights by practically putting a total ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and she buffaloes even after the animal had ceased to be useful and thus virtually put an end to their profession and trade. Held, (i) that the ban on the slaughter of bulls, bullocks and she buffaloes below the age of 20 or 25 years was not a reasonable restriction in the interests of the general public and was void. A bull, bullock or buffalo did not remain useful after 15 years, and whatever little use it may have then was greatly offset by the economic disadvantages of feeding and maintaining unserviceable cattle. The additional condition that the animal must, apart from being above 20 or 25 years of age, also be unfit was a further unreasonable restriction. Section 3 of the Bihar Act, section 3 of the U. P. Act and section 4(2)(a) of the M. P. Act were invalid. (ii) Rule 3 of the Bihar Rules was bad as it imposed dis proportionate restrictions on the rights of the petitioners. The procedure involved such expenditure of money and time as made the obtaining of the certificate not worthwhile. (iii) The provisions in the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh Acts providing that the animal shall not be slaughtered within 20 and10 days respectively of the issue of the certificate and that any person aggrieved by the order of the competent authority, may appeal against it, were likely to hold up the slaughter of the animal for a long time and practically put a total ban on slaughter of bulls, bullocks and buffaloes even after they had ceased to be useful. These provisions imposed unreasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights of the petitioners and were void. Mohd. Hanif Quareshi vs The State of Bihar, [1959] S.C.R. 629, State of Madras vs V. G.

            "Target: This appeal arises out of an action for damages for harassment and for an injunction to restrain its continuance. The question at issue is in what circumstances can such an action be defended on the ground that the alleged harasser was engaged in the prevention or detection of crime. Mr Willoughby was employed by one of Mr Hayess companies. In 2002, the two men fell out. In late 2003, Mr Willoughby embarked on a campaign against Mr Hayes centring on allegations of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion in relation to Mr Hayess management of his companies. This took the form of sending numerous letters to the Official Receiver, the police and the Department of Trade and Industry. These bodies investigated and found no basis in the allegations, but Mr Willoughby continued to press these bodies and made a series of intrusions into Mr Hayess private life. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 (the Act) makes harassment a civil wrong and a criminal offence, but under s.1(3) of the Act it is a defence for a person to show (a) that it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting a crime; (b) that it was pursued under any enactment or rule of law, or (c) that in the particular circumstances, the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable. The trial judge found that Mr Willougbys conduct constituted harassment under s.1(1) of the Act but that he had a defence under s.1(3)(a) because he genuinely believed in the allegations involving Mr Hayes and wished to persist in investigating them. The Court of Appeal allowed Mr Hayess appeal on two main grounds: (1) only the purpose of the conduct not the purpose of the alleged harasser was relevant, and in this case it was not reasonably or rationally connected to the prevention of crime; and (2) the prevention of crime had to be the sole purpose of the alleged harasser, and the intrusions on Mr Hayess privacy were not related to that purpose. The Supreme Court dismisses the appeal by Mr Willoughby by a majority of four to one (Lord Reed Dissenting). Lord Sumption gives the judgment of the Court. There is no distinction between the purpose of the conduct and the purpose of the alleged harasser as such acts have no purpose other than that of their perpetrator. The issue is by what standard that persons purpose is to be assessed [10]. A wholly objective test (adopted by the Respondent) is not consistent with the wording or purpose of the Act. A test of reasonableness was not included in s.1(3)(a), as it was in other sections of the Act. It would also render the general defence of reasonableness in s.1(3)(c) otiose [11]. A wholly subjective test (adopted by the Appellant) is equally problematic [12]. Those who claim to be acting for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime may, at a purely subjective level, entertain views about what acts are crimes and what steps are calculated to prevent or detect them which have no relation to reality. Mere existence of belief, however absurd, in the mind of the harasser that he is detecting or preventing a crime, cannot justify him persisting in a course of conduct which the law recognises as oppressive. Some control mechanism is therefore required, even if it falls short of what is objectively reasonable [13]. The necessary control mechanism is to be found in the concept of rationality, familiar in public law but also increasingly significant in other areas, such as contractual discretions. Rationality is different to reasonableness. Reasonableness is an external, objective standard applied to the outcome of a persons thoughts or intentions. A test of rationality only applies a minimum objective standard to the relevant persons mental processes. It imports a notion of good faith in requiring some rational connection between the evidence and the ostensible reasons for the decision, and an absence of arbitrariness, capriciousness or reasoning so outrageous in its defiance of logical as to be perverse [14]. If the alleged harasser has rationally applied his mind to the material suggesting criminality and formed the view that the conduct said to constitute harassment was appropriate for its detection or prevention, the court will not test his conclusions by reference to what view a hypothetical reasonable man in his position would have formed. If he has not done so but proceeds anyway, he acts irrationally. He will not have a relevant purpose and there will be no causal connection between his purpose and the conduct constituting harassment. Such a test would in any event apply to public authorities. It is not a demanding test, and it is hard to imagine that Parliament could have intended anything less [15]. Applied to the facts, this tests means that after June 2007, Mr Willoughbys conduct against Mr Hayes was more than objectively unreasonable. It was irrational. He was no longer guided by any assessment of evidence, nor was there a rational connection between his supposed purpose and acts. By persisting in pressing his allegations on the Official Receiver and other investigatory bodies long after they refused to deal with him, he was acting in way that was incapable of furthering the alleged purpose [16]. Although not strictly necessary to decide the point, it was also held that for the purpose of s.1(3)(a) the prevention or detection of crime need not be the sole purpose of the alleged harasser, but only the dominant one [17]. Lord Reed (dissenting) agrees that reasonableness is not required under s.1(3)(a), but rejects the idea that Parliament intended to impose a rationality requirement for three reasons: (1) Parliament did not provide for any rationality test. (2) A statute should not be construed as extending criminal liability beyond the limits which Parliament itself enacted it. (3) Criminal liability would turn on the subtle distinction between irrationality and unreasonableness, which could create particular difficulties in giving clear directions to juries [24 28]. \n",

There is an issue about whether he also owns them, and (b) which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other. Harassment is both a criminal offence under section 2 and a civil wrong under section 3.

            "Target: Six individuals were involved in road traffic accidents involving vehicles whose drivers were insured by the appellant insurance company, Haven Insurance Company Limited (Haven). They all entered into conditional fee agreements (CFAs) with the respondent solicitors firm, Gavin Edmondson Solicitors Limited (Edmondson). Edmondson notified the claims via the online Road Traffic Accident Portal (the Portal), in accordance with the Pre action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents (the Protocol). Under this scheme, the solicitors lodge the details of the claim on the Portal, the insurers respond by admitting or denying liability, and then, if liability is admitted, the amount of the damages are negotiated, with recourse to a court hearing if the amount cannot be agreed. Under the Protocol, the insurer is expected to pay the solicitors fixed costs and charges direct to the solicitors. In this case, however, shortly after the claims were logged on the Portal, Haven made settlement offers direct to the claimants, on terms which did not include any amount for the solicitors costs. Haven told the claimants that they could pay the claimants more, and more quickly, by that route, than by going through the Portal. All the individuals eventually accepted these offers, and cancelled their CFAs with Edmondson. This practice by Haven has been repeated in many other cases, which are not before the court. Edmondson claimed against Haven for the fixed costs which it should have been paid under the Protocol. Specifically, Edmondson sought enforcement of the solicitors equitable lien. This is a form of security for the payment of fees owed by the client for the successful conduct of litigation, paid out of the fruits of that litigation. Edmondsons claim was dismissed at first instance. The Court of Appeal allowed their appeal, holding that, even though the claimants did not have a contractual liability for the firms charges, which meant that the traditional equitable lien claim failed, the remedy could be modernised to allow the solicitors to recover from the insurers their fixed costs that should have been paid under the Protocol. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. Lord Briggs gives the lead judgment, with which the rest of the Court agrees. Edmondson are entitled to the enforcement of the traditional equitable lien against Haven, as the client owed a contractual duty to pay the solicitors charges. However, the equitable lien should not have been modernised in the manner undertaken by the Court of Appeal. The solicitors equitable lien: the existing law As the early cases demonstrate, the solicitors equitable lien was developed to promote access to justice. It enables solicitors to offer litigation services on credit to clients who, although they have a meritorious case, lack the financial resources to pay up front for its pursuit [1], [33 34]. The equitable lien depends upon (i) the client having a liability to the solicitor for his charges; (ii) there being something in the nature of a fund in which equity can recognise that the solicitor has a claim (usually a debt owed by the defendant to the solicitors client which owes its existence to the solicitors services to the client); and (iii) something sufficiently affecting the conscience of the payer at the time of payment, either in the form of collusion with the client to cheat the solicitor or notice or knowledge of the solicitors claim against or interest in the fund [35 37]. Construction of the CFA does the client have any contractual liability to pay the solicitors charges? The client care letter, which explained that the solicitor would be able to recover its costs from the losing side if the claimants won, so that the claimants would not need to put their hands in their own pockets, did not mean that the claimants were not contractually liable for the solicitors fees. It merely limited the recourse from which Edmondson could satisfy that liability to the amount of its recoveries from the defendant, and it both preserved and affirmed the clients basic contractual liability. This was a sufficient foundation for the lien to operate as a security for payment, on a limited recourse basis [40 44]. Did Haven have notice of Edmondsons lien? In all the cases before the court, the requirement that the settlement debts must owe their creation to Edmondsons services provided to the claimants under the CFAs was satisfied on the facts. Edmondsons actions in logging the claim on the portal contributed to the settlement in two ways. First, it supplied the details of the claim to the insurer, and second, it demonstrated the claimants serious intention to pursue the claim, and ability to do so with the benefit of a CFA [45 46], [59 63]. Once a defendant or his insurer is notified that a claimant in a road traffic accident case has retained solicitors under a CFA, and that the solicitors are proceeding under the Protocol, they have the requisite notice and knowledge to make a subsequent payment of settlement monies direct to the claimant unconscionable, as an interference with the solicitors interest in the fruits of the litigation. In this case, Haven had notice of the lien because they knew that each of the claimants had retained Edmondson under a CFA, and also knew that Edmondson was looking to the fruits of the claim for recovery of its charges [48 50]. As such, the lien could be enforced against Haven by requiring it to pay the fee amounts in the CFAs direct to Edmondson, but only up to the amount of the agreed settlement payments [65]. To that limited extent the order made by the Court of Appeal needed to be varied. The re formulation of the equitable lien by the Court of Appeal It is not strictly necessary to address this issue in view of the decision on the traditional principle above, but the correctness or otherwise of the Court of Appeals reformulation of the principle has been extensively argued, and the Law Society has intervened to support it [51 52]. There are insuperable obstacles to extending the principle to cases where, although there is no contractual liability for the charges, the Protocol is breached. This includes the fact that the Protocol is purely voluntary and created no debt or other relevant legal rights at all. Whilst equitable remedies are flexible, they still operate according to principle. One of the principles of the equitable lien is that the client must have a responsibility for the solicitors charges. There is no general principle that equity will protect solicitors from any unconscionable interference with their expectations in relation to recovery of their charges [53 58]. \n",
            "Prediction: This appeal tests the limits, in a modern context, of the long-established remedy known as the solicitors equitable lien. In its traditional form it is the means whereby equity provides a form of security for the recovery by solicitors of their agreed charges for the successful conduct of litigation, out of the fruits of that litigation. It is a judge-made remedy, motivated not by any fondness for solicitors as fellow lawyers or even as officers of the court, but rather because it promotes access to justice. Specifically it enables solicitors to offer litigation services on credit to clients who, although they have a meritorious case, lack the financial resources to pay up front for its pursuit. It was called a solicitors lien because solicitors used to have a virtual monopoly on the pursuit of litigation in the higher courts. Nothing in this judgment should be read as deciding whether the relaxation of that monopoly means that the lien is still limited only to solicitors. Solicitors\n",

            "Target: Respondent No. 1 filed a complaint under section 420 IPC against the appellants alleging that a loan taken by them from him had not been repaid. While the complaint was pending before a Magistrate the parties entered into a compromise under which the appellants undertook to repay the loan before a stipulated date. The Magistrate accordingly allowed the parties to compound the case. When the appellants failed to repay the loan in accordance with the undertaking given before the Magistrate the respondent moved the High Court for taking action against the appellants for contempt of court. On the view that the appellants had committed a willful disobedience of the undertaking the High Court held that they were guilty of civil contempt and sentenced them to one month 's simple imprisonment. Allowing the appeal in part, ^ HELD: 1. The appellants had committed willful disobedience of the court of the Magistrate by committing serious breach of the undertaking given to it on the basis of which alone they had been acquitted. The High Court was, therefore, right in holding that the appellants were guilty of civil contempt under section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act. [638 A] 2. Having regard to the circumstances of the case the present case falls within the first part of section 12(3) of the Act and a sentence of fine alone should have been awarded by the High Court. By enacting the section the legislature intended that a sentence of fine alone should be imposed in normal circumstances. Special power is, however, conferred on the court to pass a sentence of imprisonment if it thought that ends of justice so required. Therefore, before a court passed a sentence of imprisonment it must give special reasons for passing such a sentence. [638 G] In the present case there are no special reasons why the appellants should be sent to jail \n",
            "Prediction: The appellants had given a loan of Rs. 50,000/ to the appellant on certain conditions. Somehow or other, the loan could not be paid by the appellants as a result of which Respondent No. 1 filed a complaint under section 420 I.P.C. against the appellant. The High Court passed the following order: \"The accused given an undertaking to the court that he shall repay the sum of the sum on or before 21 7 1972 with interest as mentioned on the reverse. In view of the undertaking, the appellant committed wilful disobedience of the order of the court and the amount of loan was not paid to the respondent at all. Thereafter, it appears, that the appellant was found guilty of civil contempt, which should be given only where the Court is satisfied that ends of justice require the imposition of such a sentence. The respondent, therefore, moved the High Court for taking action for contempt of Court against the respondents. The Court came to the conclusion\n",

            "Target: HELD: 1. Ordinarily when a State Legislation is being interpreted the meaning received by it in the High Court as the settled intent should rarely be disturbed by the Supreme Court unless the error is so egregious, the impact goes beyond the State or like legislation elsewhere and decisions of the High Courts thereon may lead to confusion and uncertainty. [979 A B] 2. Viewing the text of Section 3, lexically literally, schematically, and in the setting of social justice of which saving the average litigant from the intoxication of tantalising litigation is component, \"No revision to the High Court\" would be the only conclusion. Purposively speaking, it will be stultifying to interpret, section 3 to mean that orders in appeal by District Courts must suffer a distant journey to revisory justice from the High Court. [980 C D] Vishesh Kumar vs Shanti Prasad, ; clarified. The short test to refuse revisory jurisdiction to the High Court is to ascertain whether the decision sought to be challenged is in a case arising out of a suit of the valuation of Rs. 20,000/ and more. If the answer is 'Yes ' then the High Court has revisory power, but if the suit from which the case arises and in which the decision is made is one where the valuation is less than Rs. 20,000/ then the litigation cannot travel beyond the District Court except in that class of cases where the decision is taken for the first time by the District Court itself in a case arising out of an original proceeding. From this angle, none of the Special Leave Petitions survive. [980 D F] After all, our District Courts are easier of access for litigants, and the High Courts, especially in large States like Uttar Pradesh, are 'untouchable ' and 'unapproachable ' for agrestic populations and even urban middle classes. Nor is there ground to distrust the District Judges. A hierarchy of courts built upon a heritage of disbelief in inferiors has an imperial flavour. If we suspect a Munsif and put a District Judge over him for everything he does, if we distrust a district Judge and vest the High Court with pervasive supervision, if we be skeptical about the High Courts and watch meticulously over all their orders, the System will break down as its morale will crack up. A psychic communicable disease of suspicion, skepticism and servility cannot make for the health of the 974 judicial system. If the Supreme Court has a super Supreme Court above it, it is doubtful whether many of its verdicts will survive, judging by the frequency with which it differs from itself. [979 E G] Observation Democracy, in a vast country of diversity, demographic immensity, logistic difficulty and large scale indigency, makes decentralisation an imperative of Administration. Access to Justice also implies early finality within reach of the rich and the poor. These considerations persuaded the U.P. State, one of direst in poverty, largest in population, and most agrestic in life style, to attempt a tepid procedural reform in the field of revision to the High Court in litigations of lesser financial stakes. Judicial reform is upto now a tinkering exercise, not an engineering project but even that little tinkering is fiercely challenged as litigative anathema by the profession which is unfortunate.

In the petition for contempt, it was alleged that these directions were not implemented, and that consequent to the filing of the writ petition, the authorities, especially local officers, were ill treating the Petitioners. On notice being issued, affidavit on behalf of respondents Nos. 1 to 3 and 5 were filed tendering unconditional apology, and explaining their positions regarding the implementation of the Court 's orders. Respondent No. 6, who was the officer ln charge of the Pension Paying officer and who was responsible for the implementation of the Court 's orders, also tendered an unconditional apology and stated, in his affidavit, that petitioner No. 9 was dispossessed of the residential accommodation on 14th August, 1987, by which time the Court 's orders of 7th August, 1987 had not been received by him, and the accommodation had already been given to another person, that petitioner No. 9 was later restored to service and given possession of similar accommodation and that the rent paid by the petitioner for the private accommodation will be paid out of Government account, and requested for condonation 281 of delay in implementing the orders of this Court. Disposing of the Petition, ^ HELD: This Court records it serious concern and disapproval of the growing conduct of parties and public officers, in particular, of ignoring the directions of the Court and the multiplying instances of confrontation. [285F] The Court, including the apex one is a part of the State and is a built in mechanism of the Constitution to administer justice in accordance with law. For discharging that duty, the Court has got to adopt an attitude of critical assessment of situations connected with litigation brought before it for adjudication. The manner of functioning of the Court in accord with the Rule of Law has to be dispassionate, objective and analytical. The Judges who preside over these courts do not act with a sense of superiority; nor do they look down upon others in the community. [285F G] In order that the system may efficiently work and the purpose for which the courts are established is duly served, it is necessary that everyone within the framework of the Rule of Law must accept the system, render due obedience to orders made and in the event of failure of compliance, the rod of justice must descend down to punish. Everyone within the system must realise this situation and should not unnecessarily get into a confrontation. [285H; 286A B] In the instant case, there is some material which if probed into further, might have established that respondent No. 6 had notice of the order of this Court before physical dispossession of the petitioner was effected. There is allegation of adoption of an attitude of resentment by respondent No. 6 or for the matter of that the local officers, when the writ petition was filed in this Court. That backdrop could supply the motive for the delay in complying with the directions of this Court. It is, however, not considered expedient to probe further into the matter on account of the fact that there has been compliance and each of the respondents has tendered unqualified apology which is accepted and the contempt notice is discharged.

Writ peti tions under Article 226 were filled by the appellants in the High Court challenging the orders of eviction passed against them, which were dismissed; hence these appeals. The writ petitioners moved this Court directly under Article 32 of the Constitution against the notices of termination of tenancy issued to them. The Public Premises Act of 1971 was preceded by two enactments the Government Premises (Eviction) Act 1950, and the Public Premises (eviction of unauthorised occupants) Act, 1958 which were declared unconstitutional by different High Courts.

Khanna, etc., AIR 1971 Delhi 1 and Northern India Caterers Private Ltd. vs State of Punjab & Anr. , ; 650 This led to the enactment of the Public Premises Act in 1971. The validity of this act was upheld by this Court in Hari Singh vs The Military Estate Officer, ; Before this Court, the contentions were advanced by the parties mainly on two questions (i) whether the provisions of the Public Premises Act were applicable to the Premises belonging to a nationalised bank; and (ii) whether the provisions of the Public Premises Act override the provi sions of the Delhi Rent Control Act. In regard to the applicability of the Public Premises act, it was inter alia contended that the premises belonging to a nationalised bank or insurance company did not fall within the ambit of the definition of 'Public Premises ' contained in Section 2(e) of the Public Premises Act for the reason that the nationalised bank was not a company as defined in Section 3 of the and it was also not a corporation established by or under a Central Act. On the other hand, it was contended that the respond ents being nationalised bank, was a corporation established by a Central Act, viz., the Bank Nationalisation Act, and the premises belonging to a nationalised bank were 'public premises ' under section 2(e)(2)(ii) of the Public Premises Act. In regard to the second question, each side claimed that the enactment relied upon by it was a special statute and the other enactment was general, and also invoked the not obstante clause contained in the enactment relied upon. In this connection, it was argued on behalf of the respondents that the Public Premises Act having been enacted by Parlia ment in exercise of legislative power under Article 246(1) of the Constitution in respect of matters enumerated in the Union List would ipso facto override the provisions of the Rent Control Act enacted in exercise of the legislative powers under Article 246(4) in respect of matters enumerated in the concurrent list. Dismissing the appeals and the writ petition, this Court, HELD: (1) The provisions of the Public Premises Act, to the extent they cover premises failing within the ambit of the Rent Control Act, override the provisions of the Rent Control Act, and a person in unauthorised occupation of public premises under Section 2(e) of the Act cannot invoke the protection of the Rent Control Act. [694D E] (2) After the second world war there has been develop ment of a new pattern of public corporation in England as an instrument of plan 651 ning in the mixed economy. The general characteristics of such a public corporation is that it is normally created by a special statute; it has no shares and no share holders, either private or public, and its share holder, in the symbolic sense, is the nation represented through Government and Parliament; and it has the legal status of a corporate body with independent legal personality. There has been a similar growth of this type of public corporation in other. countries. This trend is also evident in our country. since Independence and a number of such public corporations have been constituted by Acts of Parliament. [668A C] (3) The expression 'Corporation ' in Section 2(e)(2)(ii) of the Public Premises Act would include public corporations of the new pattern constituted under the Central Acts where in the entire paid up capital vests in the Central Govern ment. [670G] S.S. Dhanoa vs Municipal Corporation, Delhi, ; , distinguished. (4) In order to constitute a corporation it is not necessary that there should be shareholders or members and that in the new pattern of public corporation that has developed there are no shareholders or members.

(5) Provisions of the Banks Nationalisation Act show that the nationalised Bank has been constituted as a dis tinct juristic person by the Act and it is owned by the Central Government. They further indicate that the nationa lised bank has all the attributes of the new pattern of public corporation. [667B] (6) The object of the legislation in enlarging the definition of 'public premises ' in Section 2(e) of the Public Premises Act is to make available the machinery of the Act for evicting unauthorised occupants not only from the premises belonging to the Central Government but also from premises belonging to Companies, Corporation and statu tory bodies in which the Central Government has a substan tial interest. [670D E] 652 (7) Under Section 2(e)(2)(i) premises belonging to a company incorporated under the , in which not less than fifty one percent of the paid up capital is held by the Central Government, are to be treated as public enterprises. It could not be the intention of Parliament that premises belonging to public corporations whose entire paid up capital vests in the Central Government and who are the instrumentalities of State would be excluded from the ambit of the definition of 'public premises '. [670E G] (8) Keeping in view the provisions of the Banks Nation alisation Act the nationalised bank is a corporation estab lished by a Central Act and it is owned and controlled by the Central Government. The premises belonging to a nationa lised bank are public premises under Section 2(e)(2)(ii) of the Public Premises Act.

(10) No distinction can be made between premises used for residential purposes and premises used for commercial purposes in the matter of eviction of unauthorised occupants of public premises and the consideration which necessitate providing a speedy machinery for eviction of persons in unauthorised occupation of public premises apply equally to both the types of public premises. [673B C] (11) The definition of the expression 'unauthorised occupation ' contained in Section 2(g) of the Public Premises Act is in two parts. The second part of the definition is inclusive in nature and expressly covers continuance in occupation by any person of the public premises after the authority (whether by way of grant or any other mode of transfer) under which he was allowed to occupy the premises has expired or has been determined for any reason whatsoev er. The words \"whether by way of grant or any other mode of transfer\" in this part of the definition are wide in ampli tude and would cover a lease because lease is a mode of transfer under the Transfer of Property Act.

But, that, by itself, cannot be a ground for excluding from the ambit of the said Act premises in unauthorised occupation of persons who obtained possession of the said premises under a lease when the Public Premises Act and the Rules framed thereunder provide for a right of appeal of the District Judge against an order of the Estate Officer. which shows that the final order that is passed is by a judicial officer.

[682G] (15) The Public Premises Act deals with Government property as well as property belonging to other legal enti ties mentioned in clauses (2) and (3) of Section 2(e) of the Public Premises Act. In so far as it relates to eviction of unauthorised occupants from premises belonging to or taken on lease or requisitioned by or on behalf of the Central Government, the Public Premises Act would fail within entry 32 of List I being law with respect to a property of the Union. The property belonging to the various legal entities mentioned in clauses (2) and (3) of Section 2(e) of the Public Premises Act cannot be regarded as property of 654 the Union and the Public Premises Act cannot be held to have been enacted under entry 32 of List I in respect of the said properties. In so far as it deals with a lessee or licensee of premises other than premises belonging to the Central Govt; the Public Premises Act has been enacted in exercising the legislative power in respect of matters enumerated in the concurrent list. [682H; 683A C] (16) Both the statutes, viz. the Public Premises Act and the Rent Control Act, have been enacted by the same legisla ture, Parliament, in exercise of the legislative powers in respect of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List.

(17) The Rent Control Act makes a departure from the general law regulating the relationship of landlord and tenant contained in the Transfer of Property Act inasmuch as it makes provision for determination of standard rent, it specifies the grounds on which a landlord can seek the eviction of a tenant, it prescribes the forum for adjudica tion of disputes between landlords and tenants and the procedure which has to be followed in such proceedings. The Rent Control Act can, therefore, be said to be a special statute regulating the relationship of landlord and tenant in the Union Territory of Delhi.

(21) Keeping in view the object and purpose underlying both the enactments viz., the Rent Control Act and the Public Premises Act, the provisions of the Public Premises have to be construed as overriding the provisions contained in the Rent Control Act.

This indicates that Parliament intended that the provisions of the Public Premises Act would prevail over the provisions of the Rent Control Act inspite of the above mentioned provisions contained in the Rent Control Act. [691A B] (23) The scope of the provisions of the Public Premises Act cannot be cut down on the basis of an apprehension that the corporations may be induced to earn profits by purchas ing property in possession of tenants at a low price and after buying such property evict the tenants after terminat ing their tenancy and thereafter sell the said property at a much higher value. Every activity of a public authority especially in the background of the assumption on which such authority enjoys immunity from the rigours of the Rent Act, must be informed by reason and guided by the public inter est.

The freight policy taken out in January 1969, was against risk of loss or damage to any goods or merchandise during transit. In June 1971. the respondent declared to the appellant that it had received for transit a consignment of 185 packages of general merchandise alleged to be of the total value of Rs. 1,10,000/(approx) for transportation from Calcutta to various places in Assam and Tripura and paid the requisite premium on the value of goods and the goods stood insured under the said policy. According to the respondent on the evening of 29 6 71, the consignment of 185 packages was loaded in Truck No. WGH 8261, and the truck left Calcutta on the same day for Gauhati. It is alleged that the owner of the truck reached Barasat on the night of 29th June, 1971, there was a robbery and neither the truck, nor the driver, nor the merchandise could be traced. On 1 7 1971, the respondent sent letters to the officer incharge of Jorabagan Police Station, the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Intelligence Branch, Lall Bazar. Calcutta and the Deputy Commissioner of Police Intelligence Branch intimating them that the truck, the driver, the assistant and the merchandise could not be traced. A copy of the letter sent to the Assistant Commissioner of Police. Lall Bazar, Calcutta was sent to the appellant and it was received by the appellant on 2 7 1971. On 1 7 1971 and 21 9 1971, the respondent lodged the claim for loss with the appellant on the basis that the loss was covered by the policy. On 3 7 1971, the appellant sent a, letter to the respondent calling upon the respondent to furnish the particulars as regards the name and address of the owner of the vehicle, the name and ' address of the driver and other particulars. On 21 9 1971 the respondent informed the appellant by a letter that the information and the records asked for in the letter dated 3 7 1971 were already supplied to Mr. A. L. Chopra, the agent of the appellant on 5 7 1971 when he called upon the respondent for that, purpose. On 10 10 1971. the appellant wrote to the respondent informing that until the report of the investigation by the police was produced by the respondent, it would not be possible for the appellant to proceed further in the matter. The appellant received a copy of the investigation report by the police at Barasat on 12 5 1972. The report was to the effect that the alleged episode, of robbery was false. On this basis, the appellant sent to the respondent a letter dated 4 8 1972 stating the contents of the investigation report of the police at Barasat asking for the investigation report of Jambagan Police Lall Bazar Police. Thereafter the appellant intimated the respondent by letter dated 16 2 1973 disclaiming its liability under the freight policy as regards the loss of the consignment of 185 packages. On receipt of the letter, the respondent wrote to the appellant on 30 3 73 asking for the ground on which the appellant disclaimed its liability. The appellant sent a letter after two months on May 30, 1973, stating that it had nothing to add to what had been stated in its letter dated February 16, 1973. Thereafter, the respondent took the advice of solicitors and counsel. On 17 8 1973, the respondent filed the application before the High Court under section 37(4) of the Act for extension of time for referring the dispute to arbitration till a date 15 days after the order of the High Court. In the application the respondent stated the reasons for the delay in filing the application in court after receiving the letter dated May 30, 1973. In answer to the application, the appellant contended that section 37(4) of the Act had no application that the Court had no jurisdiction to extend the time and that even if the court had 137 jurisdiction, there were no valid grounds for extension. The learned Judge of the High Court passed the order extending the time to refer the dispute to arbitration within a fortnight from 14 1 1974. In this appeal by special leave, it was contended for appellant that there would be no undue hardship to the respondent if the time for preferring the claim to arbitration is not extended and, therefore, the High Court went wrong in exercising its discretion by extending the time. Rejecting the contention and dismissing the appeal, HELD ; (i) Court has to take a liberal view of the meaning of the words \"undue hardship\" occurring in section 37(4) of the .

Ltd. vs British Phosphate Commissioners ; and Librarian Shipping etc. vs A King & Sorts referred to (ii) The respondent was having dealings with the appellant in the business of insurance from 1958 onwards and in no instance was the claim made by the respondent rejected by the appellant. The conduct of the respondent in enquiring of the appellant the grounds on which the claim was rejected was quite reasonable. It was only after the grounds of rejection were known that the respondent could have decided whether to resort to arbitration or not. If the grounds of rejection would come within the clause of exclusion of liability under the Policy, it would serve no purpose to incur the expense and hardship involved in resorting to arbitration. The appellant did not give the reason for disclaiming liability even in its letter dated 30 5 1973. We do not think that there was any lack of promptness on the part of the respondent in waiting for the reply to its letter dated 30 3 1973. In the facts and circumstances of the case it is clear that the High Court exercised its discretion properly in extending the time. The conduct of the respondent was reasonable. It took all steps it could when it knew about the alleged robbery to inform the police and the appellant. The fact that the Barasat police reported that the case was false does not necessarily mean that the respondent tried to practise any fraud on the appellant. The respondent had filed a suit against the owner of the truck in question in July 1972 for the recovery of the amount of loss. It also paid the claims arising out of the loss of goods which were transported through the truck. All these go to show the bona fides and reasonableness of the conduct of the respondent. Both the amount at stake and the reasons for delay are material in considering the question of undue hardship. It cannot be said that any material prejudice would be caused to the appellant by extending the time. There would be undue hardship if time is not extended, as the consequence of non extension would in any event be excessive and out of proportion to the fault of the respondent, if any, in not being prompt. It also cannot be, said that the mere fact that a claim would be barred would be undue hardship. [144B C; 14; 145A B] \n",

That the Court would not enter into credibility of the evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion for that of the High Court; 4. That the Court would interfere where the High Court has arrived at a finding of fact in disregard of a judicial process, principles of natural justice or a fair bearing or has acted in violation of a mandatory provision of law or procedure resulting in serious prejudice or injustice to the accused; 5.

            "Target: The respondent is a non proprietary members ' club. It is organised on a vast scale with multifarious activities providing a venue for sports and games, and facilities for recreation, entertainment and for catering of food and refreshment. Guests are admitted but on the invitation of members. It has 194 employees with a wage bill between one lakh and two lakh rupees. For the year 1962, the employees claimed bonus but the Industrial Tribunal held that the club was not an 'industry ' within the meaning of the , and rejected the claim of the employees% In appeal to this Court. Held: (1) The definitions of industrial dispute 'employer ' and 'workman ' show that an industrial dispute can only arise in relation to an 'industry '. The definition of 'industry ' is in two parts, the first, from the point of view of employers and the second, from the angle of employees. In its first part it means any 'trade, business, undertaking, manufacture or calling of employers '. This part determines an industry by reference to occupation of employers in respect of those activities specified by the five words and they determine what an 'industry ' is, and what the cognate expression 'industrial ' is intended to convey. But the second part standing alone cannot define 'industry '. If the existence of an industry viewed from the angle of what the employer is doing is established, all who render service and fall within the definition of 'workman ' come within the fold of industry ' irrespective of what they do. Thus, the cardinal test is to find out whether there is an industry according to the denotation of the word in the first part. [753 A 754 H]. Taking the words in the definition of 'industry ' the word 'trade ' means exchange of goods for goods or goods for money, or, any business carried on with a view to profit, whether manual or mercantile as distinguished from the liberal arts or learned professions and from agriculture. The word 'business ' means an enterprise which is an occupation as distinguished from pleasure. and 'manufacture ' is a kind of productive industry in which the making of articles or material, often on a large scale, is by physical labour or mechanical power. The word 'calling ' denotes the following of a profession or trade. [756 F H]. The word 'undertaking ' has figured in the cases of this Court. In D. N. Banerjee vs P. R. Mukherjee, [1953] S.C.R. 302 it was observed that the word is not to be interpreted by association with the words that precede or follow it in the definition of 'industry '. But the settled view of this Court is: that primarily industrial disputes occur, when the operation undertaken rests upon cooperation between employers and employees with a view to production and dis tribution of material goods, in other words, wealth, but they may 743 arise also in cages where the cooperation is to produce material services. For an 'undertaking ' to be an industry, it is not necessary that it must be carried on with capital by private enterprise or that it must be commercial or result in profit but there must be systematic activity and it must be analogous to the carrying on of a trade or business involving co operation between employers and em ployees. But every human activity in which the relationship of employers and employees enters, is not necessarily creative of an industry. Personal services rendered by domestic and other servants, administrative services of public officials . services in aid of occupations of professional men such as doctors and lawyers etc. , employ ment of teachers and so on, may result in relationships in which there are employers on the one side and employees on the other, but they have been excluded because they do not come within the connotation of the term 'industry ' as the service rendered is not a material service. Therefore, the word 'undertaking ', though elastic, must take its colour from other expressions used in the definition of 'industry ', and must be defined as any business or any work or project resulting in material goods or material services and which one engages in or attempts as an enterprise analogous to business or trade. L740 D; 756 D F; 758 D E; 757 B C; 758 B C]. In the present case, the activity of the club is conducted with the aid of employees who follow callings or avocations. But taking the first part of the definition and the essential character of the club, the activity of the club cannot be described as a 'trade ' business or manufacture ' and the running of clubs is not the 'calling ' of the respon dent club or its managing committee. Also, the club has no existence apart from its members. It exists for its members though occasionally strangers also take benefit from its services. Even with the admission of guests, the club remains a members ' self serving institution. Though the material needs or wants of a section of the community is catered for it is not done as part of trade or business or as an undertaking analogous to trade or business. Therefore, the Tribunal was right in holding that the respondent club was not an industry. [760 A H]. Baroda Borough Municipality vs Workmen , referred to Observations contra in Bengal Club Ltd. vs Shantiranjan Som maddar & Anr. A.I.R. 1956 Cal. 545 and Royal Calcutta Golf Mazdoor Union vs State of West Bengal, A.I.R. 1956 Cal. 550, disapproved. (2) The case of State of Bombay vs Hospital Mazdoor Sabha, ; so far as it relied on the test, namely; could the activity be carried on by a private individual or group of individuals for the purpose of holding that running a Government hospital was an industry must be held. to have taken an extreme view of what is an industry. This test is not enlightening because, there is hardly any activity which private enterprise cannot carry on. [751 D E; 761 A; 750 E F]. (3) In Corporation of City of Nagpur vs Employees. ; this Court relied upon the same test with an unfortunate result. The Court held that the municipal functions of the Corporation, including running a primary school, were covered by the words 'trade and business ' in C.P. & Berar Industrial Disputer. Settlement Act, 1947, since those functions were not regal, the activity was organised, service was rendered, and the functions could not be performed by an individual or firm for remuneration, while, in University of Delhi vs Ramnath [1964] 2 S.C.R. 703, this Court held that educational institutions were not 'industry '. [750 B G; 758 A B]. 744 (4) The fresh test laid down in Ahmedabad Textile Industry Research Association vs State of Bombay, ; that, to be an 'industry ', the employees therein must not share in the product of their labour cannot be regarded as universal, because, there are occasions when the workmen receive a share of the produce as part of their wages or as bonus or as a benefit. [759 C]. (5) The additional test laid down in National Union of Commercial Employees vs Meher (The Solicitor case) [1962] Supp. 3 S.C.R. 157, that, to be an 'industry ' the association of capital and labour must be direct and essential cannot also be regarded as universal because, what partnership can exist between the Board of Directors of a Company on the one hand and the menial staff employed to sweep floors on the other? [753 A]. (6) In Harinagar Cane Farm vs State of Bihar, ; and in the University case this Court observed that it must refrain from laying down unduly broad or categorical propositions. But the attempt to avoid generalizations his one disadvantage, because, taking each operation by itself and determining on the basis of facts whether it is an industry without attempting to pin point whether it is a 'business, or a trade, or an undertaking or manufacture, or calling of employers ' is to ignore the guidance afforded by the sta tute through its dictionary and to rely upon decisions dealing with the problem without a definition.

The appellant was declared elected to the State Assembly in the General Elections. In his election petition the respondent, a defeated candidate, contended that improper rejection at the time of counting of votes cast in his favour and improper reception of votes at the time of poll ing in favour of the appellant had materially affected the result and that therefore the appellant 's election should be declared void. The High Court held that certain votes had been improp erly received in favour of the appellant, certain votes validly polled in favour of the respondent were improperly rejected at the time of counting; and in respect of 550 votes which were found to have been improperly received, the High Court held that the appellant was the greatest benefi ciary of those votes although the precise number by which he was benefited could not be easily ascertained. In appeal, this Court directed the Registrar to scruti nise the 550 ballot papers to find out as to how many of those votes were cast in favour of the appellant and the other candidates. The result of the investigation showed that the appellant had a lead of 38 votes over the respond ent. Allowing the appeal HELD: There is no escape from the conclusion that the election of the appellant should be upheld. [303H] (1) In an election petition founded upon the ground that the result of the election was materially affected by the improper reception or rejection of votes, the Court has first to decide whether certain ballot papers were improperly received or were improperly rejected. Once that controversy is resolved, the rest is purely a matter of arithmetical calculation. If the result of arithmetical calculation is that the returned candidate has still a lead over his nearest rival, his election would not be declared to be void on the ground of improper reception or improper rejection of votes. Improper reception or improper rejec tion of votes can result in invalidating the election only if such improper reception or improper rejection materially affects the result of the election. [303H] In the instant case, even after excluding all the votes found to have been improperly received by the appellant and also giving credit to the respondent for the votes found by the High Court to have been improperly rejected at the time of counting, the net result still was that the appellant had a lead over the respondent. (2) As it is not permissible to widen the scope of an election petition, the respondent could not seek relief on grounds which were not taken by him in the election peti tion. The respondent could not derive any benefit on the irregularities committed in the conduct of election. The election was not challenged on the ground of any irregulari ty or non compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or of the Representation of the People Act nor was the election assailed on the ground of corrupt practice. [304D & C] 298 (3) The contention of the respondent that if the ballot papers which bore the initials and not the full signatures of the presiding officer are rejected, the appellant 's election should be declared void, is without force. The ballot papers bore the distinguishing marks as required by r. 38(1). The fact that the returning officer did not reject the ballot papers on the ground that they bore only the initials and not the full signatures of the presiding officer showed that the returning officer was satisfied that the alleged defect was caused by the mistake or failure on the part of the presiding officer. There can be no doubt that the mistake occurred because of the mistake or failure of the presiding officer. The first proviso to r. 56(2) of the Rules provides that where the returning officer is satisfied that any defect mentioned in cl. (g) or cl. (h) of this Rule has been caused by any mistake or failure on the part of a presiding officer or polling officer, the ballot paper shall not be rejected merely on the ground of such defect.

            "Target: The Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, was enacted, as indicated in the preamble, for providing for the acquisition by the State of unworked land containing or likely to contain coal deposits, and under section 4(1) of the Act, the Central Government was empowered to issue a notification with reference to its intention to prospect for coal from land in any locality. By section 5(b) any mining lease granted to a person and in respect of which a notification had been issued shall cease to have effect, and under section 7 the Central Government was entitled to acquire the mining rights within a period of two or three years from the date of the notification. On July 29, 1960, the Central Government published a notification under s, 4(1) of the Act in respect of an area included in the colliery in which the petitioners had acquired mining rights. Between the year 1932 and the month of May, 1960, the colliery was not worked because it was uneconomical to work it, but the petitioners made an application on December 3, 1959, to the Coal Board for permission to reopen the Colliery and though no reply was received from the Board, the petitioners commenced drilling operations in May, 1960, but discontinued them from August 12, 1960, in view of the notification. The petitioners challenged the validity of the notification on the ground that the preamble of the Act and sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 show that the Act was applicable only to unworked mines which must mean virgin lands,, and not to those which were being worked at the time of notification or which were worked in the past, whereas the petitioners ' coal field had been worked and the working had ceased for some time only due to the unremunerative market for the produce. The petitioners also contended that the Act contravened articles 19(1)(g) and 31(2) of the Constitution of India on the grounds (1) that the effect of a notification under the Act was to prevent an owner or lessee of a mine from working for two or three years, which was too long a period and, therefore, the restrictions could not be regarded as 45 reasonable, (2) that the Act did not contain any provision for compensation for the deprivation of the petitioners ' right to carry on their business for two or three years, and (3) that section 13 of the Act, though it dealt with the payment of compensation, did not provide for compensation for mineral rights. Held: (1) that the expression \"unworked land\" occurring in the preamble of the Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act, 1957, means land which was not being worked at the time of the notification issued under the Act and includes dormant mines. Where the object or meaning of a enactment is not clear, the preamble may be resorted to to explain it. In re the Kerala Educatiion Bill, 1957, [1959] S.C.R. 995. referred. (2) that the Act is applicable not only to virgin lands but also to dormant collieries or unworked lands, including mines which were worked in the past but mining operations therein are not being carried on at present. (3) that the expression \"to undertake any operation in the land\" in section 5(b) of the Act refers to the undertaking of an operation on land not for the first time only but at the resumption of an operation which had been abandoned or discontinued. The resumption of the working of a mine after a casual closure or a closure in the ordinary course of the working of a mine would not fall within the bar created by section 5(b). (4) that the restrictions imposed upon an owner or lessee of a mine by which he is prevented from working his mine for a certain period of time under ss.4 and 5 of the Act are not unreasonable and that the Act does not contravene article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

It is unsafe to base a conviction solely on expert 's opinion without substantial corroboration. In the instant case, it would be extremely hazrdous to condemn the appellant merely on the strength of opinion 'evidence of a handwriting ' expert.

(2) In the instant case, the circumstance that the appellant was on leave from 1st August 1964 to 16th August 1964 does not lead to the inferences that he had gone to Ludhiana in connection with the sale of iron sheets and that he was present in Ludhiana on 6th August 1964. The identification by Ram Nath after some hesitation, the improbability of identifying after 21/2 years a person who is supposed to have merely accompanied another only once and the inability of Joginder Lal to identify him all these are circum stances, which militate the prosecution theory of the appel lant 's presence. No conviction can therefore, be founded on such evidence. [lO12D A, 1013 A B] (3) In the instant case the various facts, namely, inability of the Police to trace Umedi Lal or even Bhoja Ram who was frequently going to the Railway Station for taking delivery of goods on behalf of M/s. Jindal Khemka & Co. and apprehend them, the passing on of the forged exhibit PW10/A to joginder Lal by Umedi Lal, a stranger without insisting on payment and even without settling the bargain, the delivery of the goods the next day to Umedi La1 by Teja Singh who earlier suspected the genuineness of the RR when presented by Joginder Lal,the return of the iron sheets on the advice of some, broker on the non production by Umedi Lal of a bill of purchase, taking a receipt exhibit PW45/A when Umedi Lal removed back his goods etc. prima facie indicate that Umedi Lal was a fictitious person and M/s. Jindal Khemka & Co. were not absolutely innocent in so far as this transaction was concerned. This iron sheets appeared to have been taken delivery of by. M/s. Jindal Khamka & Co. for themselves on the strength of the forged Railway Receipt No. PWIO/A. But some how or the other, due to police inaction, they appear to have escaped and a small man like the appellant seems to have been made a scape goat. The prosecution has totally failed to bring home the charge against the appellant.

            "Target: The respondent, a government official, while residing in Government quarters sought permission of the Rent Controller under section 21 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 for leasing out a portion of his house to the appellant for residential purposes for 18 months as he did not require it for his own use for that period. The appellant declared before the Rent Controller that he accepted the statement of the respondent and that he shall vacate the premises on the expiry of the period of 18 months. The Rent Controller, thereupon, passed an order granting permission in terms of the declaration. When after expiry of the stipulated period the appellant failed to vacate the leased portion, the respondent filed an execution application for recovering possession. The Rent Controller as well as the Appellate Authority rendered concurrent finding to the effect that the tenancy came into effect only by reason of the permission granted by the Rent Controller under section 21 and directed the appellant to deliver possession to the respondent. In second appeal before the High Court it was contended by the appellant that since the lease agreement was not reduced to writing, as required under section 21 of the Act, the permission granted by the Rent Controller was not valid. Dismissing the appeal the High Court held that in as much as the parties had made statements before the Rent Controller and duly signed them, there was sufficient compliance with the terms of section 21 and it was not necessary that there should be a separate agreement in writing over and above the draft agreement and the statements rendered before the Rent Controller. 938 In the appeal by special leave, the contention taken before the High Court was reiterated, and in addition it was contended for the first time that the permission obtained by the respondent from the Rent Controller under section 21 was in fraud of the statute inasmuch as he had been obtaining such permission on several occasions for short periods in order to deprive the tenants of their rights under the Act. Dismissing the appeal, HELD: 1.1 A plea pertaining to fraudulent practice is a mixed question of fact and law. Without the requisite foun dation on facts to prove a wilful contravention or abuse of a provision of law a finding cannot be rendered as to wheth er a party has committed a fraud by abusing any legal provi sion. [943FG] 1.2 In the instant case, the appellant had not cross examined the respondent with reference to the lease granted earlier by the respondent to other tenants nor had he ad duced independent evidence to prove the factum of those leases and such leases being granted by abuse of the provi sions of section 21 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. In the absence of factual material to show the abuse or misuse of the provisions of section 21, it cannot be said that the respond ent had practised fraud on the Rent Controller in obtaining permission. Besides, even if the respondent had let out different portions of the building to other tenants on earlier occasions by having recourse to section 21 he may have done so on the basis of bona fide grounds and genuine calcu lations and his calculations may have gone wrong due to factors or events beyond his control. The mere fact of letting out of the premises once again by resort to section 21 for a limited period should not necessarily lead to the inference that from the very beginning the premises were available for letting out indefinitely. [943EF, G 944A, 946A] Dhanwanti vs D.D. Gupta, (AIR referred to. 1.3 The respondent was a government servant and was living in Government quarters. He had an apprehension that the said allotment may be cancelled because of his owning a house and so he had to provide for any contingency resulting from such cancellation and hence he felt he would be able to spare the leased premises only for a limited period. There was no material before the Rent Controller to establish or even to arouse suspicion that the respondent was playing a fraud on the statute. In such circumstances the order passed by the Rent Controller cannot be said to be vitiated in any manner. [945AB] 939 S.B. Noronah vs Prem Kumari Khanna, ; , applied. V.S. Rahi vs Ram Chambeli, ; , distinguished. The appellant has waited for the full term of the lease to raise objections about the respondent playing a fraud on the statute. He has failed to put forth these objections within a reasonable time, after the permission was granted by the Rent Controller, to impugn the order on the ground of the alleged fraud perpetrated by the respond ent,. This factor weakens the objections raised by the appellant and denudes them of force and content. [946CD] J.R. Vohra vs India Export House, ; at 911 912, referred to. In the matter of interpretation of a local statute the law settled by the High Court over a continuous period of time should normally be adhered to and should not be disturbed. The Delhi High Court has consistently held that section 21 of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 is a complete Code by itself, and a permission granted thereunder would not become invalid either on account of the landlord failing to disclose the reasons for non requirement of the leased premises for a particular period or because of the landlord and the tenant not entering into an agreement in writing subsequent to the grant of permission under section 21 or on account of the agreement of tenancy in writing not being subsequently registered. A different view would not only introduce an element of uncertainty and confusion but it would also have the effect of unsettling transactions which might have been entered into on the faith of those deci sions.

            "Target: Ahava was a shop in Covent Garden, London, which mainly sold beauty products processed from Dead Sea mineral materials. The products were factory produced by an Israeli company, in an Israeli settlement located in the West Bank and therefore within the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT). It was said that the factory was staffed by Israeli citizens encouraged by the Government of Israel to settle there. Mr Richardson and Ms Wilkinson (the Defendants) sought to disrupt the activities of Ahava. On 2 October 2010 they entered the shop (together with other helpers) carrying a concrete tube. They connected their arms through the tube anchored by a chain, secured by a padlock to which they claimed to have no key. They were asked to leave the shop by an Ahava employee, but failed to do so. The employee called the police and, after some time, closed the shop. Tools were used to release the Defendants from the tube. On their release, they were arrested for aggravated trespass contrary to section 68 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (the 1994 Act). That offence criminalises the conduct of a person A who (i) trespasses on land, (ii) where there is a person or persons B lawfully on the land who is engaged in or about to engage in a lawful activity, (iii) and A does an act on the land, (iv) intended by A to intimidate all or some Bs from engaging in that activity, or to obstruct or disrupt that activity. In the magistrates court, the Defendants contested the charge on point (ii). They argued that Ahavas activities were not lawful since they involved the commission of one or more of four criminal offences. Firstly, they said that Ahava was guilty of aiding and abetting the transfer by Israeli authorities of Israeli citizens to the OPT, a territory under belligerent occupation. This was argued to be contrary to Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention 1949, which constituted a war crime. Ahavas actions in aiding and abetting the transfer, if true, would constitute an offence under sections 51 52 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 (the war crimes offence). Secondly, they said that since Ahava was aiding and abetting a war crime, Ahava must know or suspect that the products sold in the shop were the products of that offence. Ahava was therefore, they argued, guilty of the offence of using or possessing criminal property (the criminal property offence). Thirdly, they argued that the products had been imported into the UK purportedly under the EC Israeli Association Agreement, which conferred tax or excise advantages. However, since the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled that products originating in the OPT do not fall under this Agreement, they asserted that Ahava was guilty of the offence of cheating the revenue (the revenue offence). Fourthly, they emphasised that the products sold were labelled Made by Dead Sea Laboratories Ltd, Dead Sea, Israel. The OPT is not recognised as part of Israel. Therefore, they argued, Ahava was guilty of labelling offences under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 and the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 2008 (the labelling offences). The district judge in the magistrates court convicted the Defendants. They appealed, on the grounds above, to the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court upheld the conviction, but certified as a matter of general public importance the question whether the words lawful activity in section 68 of the 1994 Act should be limited to acts or events integral to the activities at the premises in question. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. An activity is unlawful for the purposes of section 68 only if it involves a criminal offence integral to the core activity carried on, not when any criminality is only incidental, collateral to, or remote from the activity. Applying that to the facts of this case, none of the offences alleged by the Defendants are integral to Ahavas activities. The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Hughes. The effect of section 68 of the 1994 Act is to add the sanction of the criminal law to particular acts which already constitute the civil wrong of trespass. It is not specifically aimed at individuals wishing to protest, and is to be construed in accordance with the normal rules of statutes creating criminal offences [2 4]. In order to argue that an activity is not lawful, the Defendant has to show a specific criminal offence against the law of England and Wales, which is properly raised on the evidence before the court. Once that evidential burden has been satisfied, the burden of proof lies on the Crown to disprove that offence to the criminal standard [9]. The Defendants had accepted that a merely collateral offence would not suffice to prove the defence. They argued that the activity could be defined as the particular feature of Bs acts against which A was protesting or objecting: if that particular feature was unlawful, this would suffice for section 68. This, however, turns the section upside down. To apply the section, it is necessary first to consider what Bs lawful activity is, and then to ask whether that is the activity which A intends to disrupt. The Defendants argument involves considering As motive, rather than As intent: A intends to disrupt the whole activity [12]. The true purpose of section 68 is to add the sanction of the criminal law to a trespass where A disrupts an activity that B is entitled to pursue. The no lawful activity defence must therefore apply when the criminal offence is integral to the core activity carried on, not merely incidental or collateral to that activity [13]. However, if a criminal offence integral to the core activity is raised, the court must consider that question even if it involves assessing extraneous facts, or the conduct of third parties [14 15]. Applying those principles to this case, none of the offences raised by the Defendants are made out. The war crimes offence: The only evidence raised by the Defendants was that a different company (the manufacturing company) had employed Israeli citizens at a West Bank factory and that the local community, which held a minority shareholding in that manufacturing company, had advertised the settlement to prospective settlers. It is very doubtful that the manufacturing companys actions could amount to aiding and abetting the transfer of Israeli citizens to the OPT, but even if it did, this could not amount to an offence by Ahavas retailing arm. Moreover, any such assistance is not an integral part of the activity carried out by Ahava, which was retail selling [17]. The criminal property offence: If, for the reasons above, there is no aiding and abetting of any unlawful movement of population, the products cannot be the products of a criminal offence. In any event, the criminal property offence cannot be said to be integral to the activity of selling [18]. The revenue offence: This is a purely collateral offence. Even if proven, the importer is only liable to repay to the Revenue duty which should have been paid [19]. The labelling offences: These are the principal offences relied on. The first Regulation criminalises misleading commercial practices, including labelling. However, it is necessary to show that, as a result of the misleading labelling, the average consumer would buy something that he/she otherwise would not have done. In this case the district judge had found that a consumer willing to buy Israeli products would be very unlikely not to buy Israeli products because they were produced in the OPT. Therefore, the offence could not have been committed [20 22]. The second Regulation criminalises the supply of cosmetic products which do not state (among other things) the country of origin. The aim of this is clearly to protect consumers, and stating that the products derive from the Dead Sea is sufficient: the Regulation is not aimed to reflect disputed questions of territoriality. Even if an offence had been shown, it would not have been integral to the sale activity [23]. \n",
            "Prediction: A person commits the offence of aggravated trespass if he trespasses on land and, in relation to any lawful activity which persons are engaging in or are about to engage in on that or adjoining land, does there anything which is intended by him to have the effect (a) of intimidating those persons or any of them so as to deter them or any other of them from engaging in that activity, or (b) of disrupting that activity (2) Activity on any occasion on the part of a person or persons on land is lawful for the purposes of this section if he or they may engage in the activity on that occasion without committing an offence or trespassing on the land The present case concerns trespassers who wished to make a protest, as do some other reported cases upon this section. But the offence is not limited to such people. Those who trespass and obstruct the activity of others might include many in different situations, such as for example business rivals or those engaged in a personal dispute, as\n",

            "Target: The petitioners were certain textile mills of Ahmedabad. They filed writ petitions under article 32 of the Constitution against assessment to proper tax by the Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad under the provisions of the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949. The following contentions fell for consideration : (i) The method of adopting a flat rate for a floor area for determining the annual value adopted by the Corporation was against the provisions of the Act, as well as against all recognised principles of valuation for the purpose of rating; it was also violative of article 14; (ii) Rules 7(2) and (3) made under the Act gave unguided power to the Commissioner to specify machinery to be treated as part of the 'land ' for the purpose of taxation and therefore were bad due to excessive delegation. They also fell beyond the ambit of Entry 49 of List 11 of the Seventh Schedule. HELD : (i) The method of levy of tax on the basis of floor area was against the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder. The latter clearly laid down that the rateable value of the property must be assessed after determining the rack rent or the annual rental value in respect of each premises which is to be computed on the basis of the annual rent for which the property might reasonably be expected to let from year to year. It did not lie in the mouth of the municipality to say that the irregularity was open to correction. [693 G H; 694 A B; 684 G H] (ii) It had not been established that condition prerequisite for determination of annual value of textile factories at Ahmedabad on the basis of the rental value per foot super of floor area existed at the relevant time, nor had it been shown that the so called contractor 's method was adopted by the Municipal authorities of Ahmedabad. The method was also not one which is generally recognised by authorities on rating. [693E] (iii) Applied indiscriminately as it appeared to have been done in the present case the method of taxation on the basis of floor area was sure to give rise to inequalities as there had been no classification of factories on any rational basis. Further there did not seem to be any basis for diving the factories and the buildings thereof under two general classes as buildings for processing and buildings for non processing purposes Article 14 was therefore clearly violated.

(iv) Rules 7(2) and (3) were invalid on account of excessive delegation of powers by the Legislature. Under these rules the specification of the classes of machinery for the purpose of taxation is done by the Commissioner with the approval of the Corporation irrespective of the question as to where they are to be found. It therefore depends on the arbitrary will of the Commissioner as to what machinery he would specify and what he would not. Moreover, he is the only person who can examine this question as there is no right of appeal. [701 D F] (v) Entry 49 in List II of the Seventh Schedule only permitted levy of tax on land and buildings. It did not permit the levy of tax on machinery contained in or situate on the building even though the machinery was there for the use of the building for a particular purpose. Rule 7(2) which levied such a tax was therefore beyond the legislative competence of the State. [701 A C] In re.

            "Target: Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1947 was applied to the Union Territory of Delhi subject to certain modifications by a notification dated 28 4 1951. Every dealer whose gross turnover exceeds the taxable quantum is liable to pay tax on sales effected by him after a specified date and while he is liable to pay tax, he cannot carry on business unless he gets himself registered and possesses a registration certificate. The tax is leviable on a dealer in respect of his taxable turnover. To compute taxable turnover of a dealer, certain deductions are required to be made from his gross turnover and one of the deductions is that set out in section 5(2)(a)(ii). What is permitted to be deducted under this provision is turnover of sales to a registered dealer of goods of the class or classes specified in his certificate of registration as being intended for resale by him or for use by him as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale. The first proviso enacts that the turnover of sales covered by section 5 (2) (a) (ii) would be deductible only if a declaration duly filled in and signed by the Registered dealer to whom the goods are sold and containing the prescribed particulars in prescribed form is furnished by the selling dealer. The requirement of such declaration as condition of deduction is clearly intended to prevent fraud and promote administrative efficiency. The second proviso provides that where any goods specified in the certificate of registration are purchased by a registered dealer as being intended for resale by him or for use by him as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale but are utilised by him for any other purpose the price of the goods purchased shall be allowed to be, deducted from the gross turnover of the selling dealer but shall be included in the taxable turnover of the purchasing dealer. There are broadly two groups in which the appeals and the writ petitions can be divided. One group consists of appeals where the assessees purchased goods of the class specified in the certificate of registration as being intended for resale by them and furnished to the dealers selling the goods, declarations in the prescribed form stating that the goods were intended for resale kind thereafter resold the goods though not within, the territory of Delhi. The second group consists of appeals where the assessees Purchased goods of the class specified in the certificate of registration as being intended for use by there. as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale and furnished to the prescribed particulars in prescribed form is furnished by the selling dealer, the dealers selling the goods declarations in the prescribed form stating that the goods were purchased by them for use as raw materials in the manufacture of goods for sale and thereafter used the goods purchased as raw materials in the manufacture of goods, in some cases outside Delhi and in some others inside, but in the after. sold the goods so manufacturer outside Delhi. The High Court of Delhi negatived the contention of the assessees that they were not covered by the second proviso to section 5(2) (a) (ii). The High Court took the view that for the purposes of section 5(2)(a)(ii) and the second proviso, resale of the goods purchased was confined to, resale inside Delhi and so also use of the goods purchased is raw materials in the manufacture of goods and 99 sale of manufactured goods were required to be, inside Delhi and, therefore, if the assessees resold the goods outside Delhi or used them as raw materials in the manufacture outside Delhi, or even if the manufacture was inside Delhi sold the goods manufactured outside Delhi, there was utilisation of the goods by the assessees for a purpose other than that for which they were purchased and hence the second proviso to section 5(2)(a)(ii) was attracted and the price of the goods purchased was liable to be included in the taxable turnover of the assessees The question for consideration was whether \"resale\" under section 5 (2) (a)(ii) and the second proviso means,resale any where without any geographical limitation or it is confined only to resale inside Delhi. The Revenue contended (1) the words \"inside the Union territory of Delhi\" are not to be found in section 5 (2) (a) (ii) and the second proviso but they must be read in these provisions as a matter of construction because (a) if resale outside Delhi were held to be within the terms of section 5(2)(a)(ii) and the second proviso, the Union territory of Delhi would lose tax altogether in cases where the goods were resold outside Delhi. The intention of the Legislature was to recover tax at only one point while the goods were in the stream of trade. (b) the Legislature had no legislative competence to tax sale outside Delhi. Therefore, resale \", 'thin the meaning of section 5(2)(a)(ii) and the second proviso could not possibly include resale outside Delhi. (c) the words \"by him\" following upon the word \"resale\" in section 5(2)(a)(ii) and the second proviso clearly indicated 'that the resale contemplated under these provisions was resale by the purchasing dealer as a registered dealer and since the concept of registered dealer has relation only to sale inside Delhi, the resale must be within the territory of Delhi. Allowing the appeals and Writ Petitions, HELD : 1. It is a well settled principle of interpretation that a statutory enactment must or ordinarily be construed according to the plain natural meaning of its language and that no words should be added, altered or modified unless it is plainly necessary to do so in order to prevent a provision from being unintelligible absurd unreasonable unworkable or totally irreconcilable with the rest of the statute. [11OA] R. vs Dakees , Federal Steam Navigation Co. Ltd: vs V. Department of Trade & Industry, , Narayanaswani vs Pannersalvam & Ors. ; relied on. Addition to or modification of words used in statutory provision is generally not permissible but the court may depart from this rule to avoid a patent absurdity. There are no words such as 'inside the Union territory of Delhi\" qualifying resale so as to limit it to resale within the territory of Delhi. The Legislature could have easily used such words if its intention was to confine resale within the territory of Delhi but it omitted to do so. [IIIA, B, E] Attorney General Sillen [1964] 2 H & C at 526 referred to. The absence of specific words limiting resale inside the territory of Delhi is not without significance and it cannot be made good bya process of judicial construction, for to do so would be to attribute to the Legislature and intention which it has not chosen to express and to usurp the legislative function. It is obvious that resale is subsequent sale after the first and it must, therefore, have the some meaning as 'sale ' defined in section 2(g). The definition of sale in section 2(g) is a general definition which does not limit it to a sale inside the territory of Delhi. Even a sale outside the territory of Delhi is within the coverage of the definition. Section 5(2)(a)(ii) does not see to impose any tax on resale. What it does is to provide deduction in respect of 100 sale to a registered dealer. Even under the second proviso, what is taxed is the ' just sale made by tile, selling dealer and not the resale made by the purchasing dealer. Thus there is no tax sought to be imposed on the resale under section 5(2)(a)(ii) or the second proviso and the argument of lack of legislative competence has no substance. It would, be straining the language of the enactment too much to say that the words \"by him\" are intended to mean by him as a registered dealer. [112B D, El G. 113D] 3. The argument of the Revenue that the Legislature could never have intended that the Union territory of Delhi should be altogether deprived of tax in cases of this kind is erroneous. It is not correct that the legislative intent was to exempt the sale. to the purchasing dealer only in those cases where the Union territory of Delhi would be able to recover the tax on resale of the goods by the purchasing dealer. It is now well settled that when the Court is construing a statutory enactment the intention of the Legislature should be gathered from the language used by it and it is not permissible to the court to speculate about the Legislative intent. [114C D] Saloman vs Saloman & Co. Ltd. ; , at 38 and, Back Clawson International Ltd. vs Papierwerke Waldhof Aschaffenburg ; at 814, relied on. Section 5(1)(a)(ii) and the second proviso occur in a taxing statute and it is a well settled rule of interpretation that in construing a taxing statute one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the Statute or the substance of the law. [116A] Cape Brandy Syndicate vs Inland Revenue Commissioner referred to. It would be flying in the face of well settled rules of construction of a taxing statute to read the words \"inside the Union territory of, Delhi\" in section 5(2)(a)(ii) and the second proviso, when the Plain and undoubted effect of the addition of such words would be to expose a purchasing dealer to penalty. [H116E] 6. During the period the department administered the Act in West Bengal and for few years in Delhi, they administered it on the basis that resale was not confined to resale inside the State of West Bengal or Union territory of Delhi. It is true that the view of the department as to the meaning of a Statute which is administered by them is not admissible as an aid to construction, because wrong practice does not make the law, but long acquiescence of the Legislature in the interpretation put upon an enactment may be regarded as some sanction and approval of it. The circumstance that for long years the Legislature did not intervene to amend the law by adding words \"inside the Union territory of Delhi\" even though the Revenue was continually administering the law on the basis that resale means resale anywhere does throw some light on the intention of the Legislature. The subsequent amendment also throws light on the intention of the Legislature. [117A E, 118A] \n",
            "Prediction: The appellants filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the validity of the Sales Tax Act, 1977. The High Court dismissed the writ petition. In appeal to this Court, the appellants contended that the sales tax Act, 1976, was not applicable to the State of West Bengal. The appellants were entitled to appeal to the Additional Commr. of Sales Tax, New Delhi for the assessment year 1973 74 in Order No. 856A, and the High Court held that the Sales tax Act was applicable to West Bengal, and that the State had no jurisdiction to raise the question of sales tax in the State. The respondents contended that in the absence of any provision in the Act, the State was not entitled to raise sales tax. The State contended that it was not a matter of law and that it could not raise sales taxes in West Bengal because the State did not have jurisdiction to do so.

            "Target: Petitioners, a recognised Export House for purposes of the Import Export Policy, 1982 83 were granted six imprest licences for the import of uncut and unset diamonds with the obligation to fulfil certain export commitment for the export of India, of cut and polished diamonds. They did not seek the revalidation and endorsement for OGL items within the time prescribed under Paragraph 185(4) of the Import Export Policy 1982 83 (AM 1983). Only in the year 1986, after a lapse of several years from the completion of their export obligations, they sought such revalidation and en dorsement. The Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Ex ports, by two orders dated 5.8.1986 and 9.4.1986, declined the request, on grounds of inordinate delay in seeking revalidation and endorsement, and on merits and permissibil ity of the claim. In the Writ Petition, the petitioners challenged these orders contending that in view of the grant of revalidation of imprest licences of two other Export Houses, consequent upon their writ petitions being allowed by the High Court and the Special Leave Petitions of the Government against the decision being dismissed by the Supreme Court, rejection by the authorities of the petitioners ' claim for similar revalidation, and endorsement of their imprest licences, was discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitu tion inasmuch as the grounds for refusal put forward by the authorities in those cases were exactly similar to those preferred in the case of the petitioners, and those grounds had been found to be insufficient in law to support the refusal, and that there was no basis for any distinction to be made in the case of petitioners who had made their demand for revalidation after the High Court 's decision in one of those cases. Dismissing the Writ Petition, 14 HELD: Petitioners are re agitating claims which they had not pursued for several years. They were not vigilant but were content to be dormant and.close to sit on the fence till somebody else 's case came to be decided. Their case cannot be considered on the anology of one, where a law had been declared unconstitutional and void by a Court, so as to enable persons to recover monies paid under the compulsion of a law later so declared void. There is also an unex plained, inordinate delay in preferring this writ petition which is brought after almost a year after the first rejec tion. [18B C] Apart altogether from the merits of the other grounds for rejection, the inordinate delay in preferring the claim before the authorities as also the delay in filing the writ petition before this Court does not pursuade this Court to interfere in this matter.

            "Target: Respondent No. 3, a displaced person from Pakistan, was allotted more than 60 standard acres of land. Out of this land he made an oral gift of some land in lieu of maintenance to his wife, respondent No. 4, who sold that land to the appellants. In the proceedings for declaration of the surplus area of the land owned by respondent No. 3 the Special Collector included the land sold to the appellants in the \"select area\" of Respondent No. 3. The appeal of Respondent No. 3 to the Commissioner was dismissed as time barred and this order was upheld in revision by the Financial Commissioner. A single Judge dismissed his petition under Article 226. In appeal, a Division Bench held that the order of the Special Collector, directing a variation in the reservation made by respondent No. 3 without his consent was not only contrary to the provisions of the Act but was without jurisdiction and a nullity in as much as the Act vested no power of such variation in the Collector. In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant, that: (1) the admission to the effect that respondent No. 3 had intimated his reserved area in Form E to the Collector before gifting the land to his wife was made before the High Court on behalf of the appellants on the basis of some misconception on the part of their counsel, that actually no such reservation was ever made and that the admission could at best be interpreted to mean that respondent No. 3 had sent an intimation in Form E to the Special Collector detailing therein the area selected by him as his permissible area in pursuance of the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B of the Act, and (2) If no reservation was made by respondent No. 3 the whole basis of the impugned judgment falls and the Collector would have jurisdiction to amend the permissible area of respondent No. 3 by way of adjustment of the equities arising in favour of the appellants. Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: In assuming that respondent No. 3 had intimated his reservation in pursuance of sub section (1) of section 5, the High Court was in error 591 and the case had to be decided on the basis of the factual position that respondent No. 3 had failed to make any reservation under that sub section but that he had made a selection in Form E in pursuance of the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B. [600 H 601A] The inclusion of the land in question in the surplus area of respondent No. 3 does not effect the right of ownership of the appellants. [604 A] 1. (a) Reservation of land was envisaged only in section 5(1) of the Act and had to be intimated within six months from the date of its commencement i.e. on or before the 15th October, 1953. [599 E] (b) No provision was ever made in the Act or the rules framed thereunder for a reservation of land by a land owner who had failed to send an intimation thereof on or before the 15th October, 1953. [599 F] (c) What was provided by section 5 B was, that a landowner who had not exercised the right of reservation under the Act could select his permissible area and send intimation thereof in Form E to the prescribed authority within a period of six months from the 11th December, 1957 i. e. on or before 11th May, 1958. 'Reservation ' was something different from the 'Selection ' of permissible area. The two terms were not only not synonymous but were mutually exclusive. 'Selection ' of permissible area was allowed only to a landlord who had not exercised his right of 'reservation '. [599 G 600 A] (d) Form E was meant only for intimation of selection of permissible area under sub section (1) of section 5B and not for reservation under sub section (1) of section 5 which could be made only through an intimation in the Form in Annexure \"B\" to the 1953 Rules. [600 B] 2.(a) 'Surplus area ' is arrived at by excluding the reserved area from the total area of a land owner in case a reservation has been made by him lawfully. (Clauses (4) and (5 a) of section 2.) [601 C] (b) Where no area has been lawfully reserved by the land owner, surplus area is worked out under section 5B or 5C. [601 D] (c) Under section 5, the landowner is entitled to reserve out of the entire land held by him in the State as landowner, any parcel or parcels not exceeding the permissible area by intimating his selection in the prescribed form to the Patwari of the estates, etc. In doing so he is legally bound to include in his reserved area such land as conforms to the description of any of the 6 categories covered by clauses (a) to (f) of the proviso to sub section (1) of section 5. [601E] (d) Once a reservation has been intimated within 6 months from the date of commencement of the Act, it cannot be varied either by act of parties or by operation of law, except with the written consent of tenant affected by such variation. (e) If a land owner has failed to reserve land in accordance with the provisions of section 5 he has another chance to select his permissible area within 6 months from the commencement of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures (Amendment) Act, 1937. [601 G] (f) The prescribed authority is given the power to select the permissible area of a landowner under sub section (2) of section 5 B but the mandatory condition attached to the exercise of that power is that it shall be resorted to only if the landowner has failed to select his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of that section. In other words, if the concerned land owner has already selected his permissible area in accordance with the provision of sub section (1) of section 5 B, sub section (2) of that section does not come into play at all and there is no occasion for the exercise by the prescribed authority or the power of selection. [602 A C ] In the instant case Respondent No. 3 had made a selection of his permissible area in accordance with the provisions of sub section (1) of section 5 B, a selection which the prescribed authority had no power to vary either under sub section (2) of section 5 B or under any other provisions of the Act. The order of the Special Collector dated March 30, 1962 was therefore passed without jurisdiction and was a nullity. [602 D E] Gurucharan Sing and Ors. vs Prithi Singh and Ors. , distinguished. \n",

The appellant intimated his reserved area in form E to the Collector before making the gift in favour of his wife. The order of the Collector was upheld in revision by the Financial Commissioner.

Two representations made by him against his detention were forwarded by the Government to the Advisory Board with its comments. He was later produced before the Advisory Board. On receipt of the Advisory Board 's report that there was sufficient cause for detention, the order of detention was confirmed by the Government. The High Court dismissed his petition under article 226 of the Constitution. In appeal the appellant challenged the order of detention on the ground that (1) it was in violation of the right guaranteed under article 22(5) inasmuch as the Government withheld consideration of the representations made by him till after the hearing by the Advisory Board, and (2) the impugned order of detention was bad due to non application of mind of the detaining authority inasmuch as the facts alleged clearly and distinctly showed that the appellant did not himself smuggle the goods. Dismissing the appeal, ^ HELD: (1)(a) There was no warrant for the submission that the disposal of the representations made by the Government was not in conformity with article 22(5) of the Constitution. [319H] (b) It is well settled that in case of preventive detention of a citizen, Art 22(5) of the Constitution enjoins that the obligation of the appropriate Government to afford the detenu an opportunity to make a representation and to consider that representation is distinct from the Government s obligation to constitute a Board and to communicate the representation, amongst other material, to the Board to. enable it to form its opinion and to obtain such opinion.

(c) The constitutional safeguards embodied in article 22(5) must be read into the provisions of section 8(b) of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Preventional of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 to prevent any arbitrary executive action. Merely because there is no express provision in section 8(b) of the Act placing an obligation to forward the representation made by the detenu along 316 with the reference to the Advisory Board unlike the provisions contained in section 9 of the and section 10 of the , it cannot be said that there is no obligation cast on the Government to consider the representation made by the detenu before forwarding it to the Advisory Board.

The power of preventive detention by the Government under the Act is necessarily subject to the limitations enjoined on the exercise of such power by article 22(5) of the Constitution. [323A] Khudiram Das vs The State of West Bengal & ors. ; referred to. In the instant case there was no infraction of constitutional safeguards enshrined under article 22(5) and there was no failure on the part of the Government to discharge its obligations under that article. Quite clearly the Government had forwarded the appellant 's two representations alongwith its comments to the Advisory Board. A perusal of the comments of the Government make it clear that the Government had already formed an opinion that the order of detention was in conformity with its powers under the law. It cannot be said that in rejecting the appellant 's representations the Government was influenced by the views expressed by the Board. At the hearing the Board had not indicated its mind as to whether there was sufficient cause for detention. It is, therefore, irrefutable that the Government had taken a decision uninfluenced by what transpired at the hearing before the Board. The matter was dealt with by the Government all: all levels, and the detaining authority had come to an independent conclusion of its own by applying its mind to the facts and circumstances of the case. [325D H] (2)(a) The intention of the legislature in enacting section 3(1) was to treat the smuggling of goods and abetting the smuggling of goods as grounds separate and distinct and both are separate grounds for detention i.e. to take in all such activities which result in accomplishment of smuggling of contraband goods. 'the term 'smuggling ' as defined in section 2(e) of the Act read with section 2(39) and s 111 of the Customs Act, is wide enough to include and make liable not only the actual smugglers but also persons abetting the smugglers, of contraband goods as well as all persons dealing with any such goods. A wider meaning is given to the term 'smuggling ' in section 2(e) of the Act with a view to broaden the scope of Preventive detention. In a case like the present where a wide 317 spread network is employed by a person, it cannot be said that he was not Engaged in the act of smuggling. The appellant was not only the person who instigated, organised and facilitated the smuggling of the contraband goods but he was really a person to whom the goods belonged. The facts set out in the ground of detention make it clear that the appellant was the person who was actually engaged in the act of smuggling of contraband goods into the Indian Customs waters For all intents and purposes the appellant was the actual smuggler and not a mere abettor His \" activities were such that his case would be covered by both clauses (i) and (ii) of section 3(1) of the Act. [326G H; 327A B] (b) Assuming that the appellant was merely an abettor in the smuggling of contraband goods on this occasion, still his activities in this transaction afforded sufficient grounds for the prognosis that he would have himself included in actual smuggling of the balance of contraband goods by remaining behind in the foreign country.

            "Target: The assessee appellant in the appeal is a non resident company having its place of business at Coven\" in the United Kingdom. It entered into a collaboration agreement with an Indian company in November, 1939 the assessee being entitled to royalty of 5% on all sales effected by the Indian Company, and this amount less the Indian tax had to be remitted by the assessee in Sterling currency. The assessee 's accounting year was the year ending 30th September and with respect to its Indian income, it was filing its returns through the Indian Company. The aforesaid collaboration agreement expired in the year 1965, but it was renewed and the renewed agreement also expired in November, 1970. For the assessment years 1967 68 and 1968 69 the assessee riled returns in which it stated that it was maintaining its accounts on mercantile basis, and did not dispute its liability to assessment. In these returns, it disclosed a royalty income of Rs. 7,21,600 and Rs. 4,57,311 respectively. When it came to the filing of the return for the assessment year 1969 70 the assessee admitted a royalty of Rs. 9,25,357 but filed a nil return saying that it was maintaining its accounts on cash basis and not on mercantile basis, that no part of the royalty amount had been received by it and, therefore, nothing was taxable. For the next assessment year 1970 71 as well, the same stand was taken by the assessee. The Income Tax Officer completed the assessment for the first two 97 assessment years on the basis of the returnes, but for the assessment years 1969 70 and 1970 71, he refused to accept the plea of the assessee; and held that the assessee maintaining its accounts on mercantile basis alone and that the royalty amount disclosed be brought to tax. The assessee filed appeals against the assessments relating to all the four years, taking the stand that even with respect to the accounting year relevant to the assessment years 1967 68 and 1968 69, it had been maintaining accounts on cash basis and since it did not actually receive any income in all these 4 years no tax was payable. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner dismissed the appeals holding that the assessment orders for the past years reveal that the method of accounting was mercantile, that for the assessment year 1967 68, the assessee never contested its liability to be taxed on the amounts disclosed and further it was not open to the assessee to change the method of accounting to suit its convenience, without the approval of the Income Tax Officer. The assessee carried the matter In further appeals to the Tribunal and contended that it was not following any particular method of accounting regularly in the past years that it was the Indian Company which was finally filing the returns of income on behalf of the assessee by incorporating the figures as per its profit and loss account, that the Indian Company was not aware of the assessee 's system of accounting in regard to royalty and that, therefore, it had committed a mistake in filing the returns for the assessment years 1967 68 and 1968 69, that as soon as the mistake had been noticed, it was corrected and returns for the assessment year 1969 70 on correct basis showing that the method of account cash receipt basis was filed. 'Me appeals were allowed the Tribunal which held that as the assessee had not been following any particular method of accounting regularly over the past years, the question of the method of accounting adopted by the assessee must be examined afresh and for that purpose remanded the matters to the Income Tax Officer. On a reference made at the instance. of the Revenue, the High Court answered the reference in favour of revenue and against assessee. The High Court held that it was 'immaterial whether the assessee was keeping his accounts in regard to a particular income regularly on the cash basis; that even if the assessee was keeping his accounts on the cash basis in regard to his income the assessee was liable to tax under Section 5 (2) (a); to hold 98 otherwise would be to take the income outside the purview of taxation under the Act, though such income had accrued in India to a non resident, and under Section 5(2)(b) the charge to tax had taken effect; and, therefore, there is no possibility of Section 5(2)(b) ever coming into operation and that Section 145(1) cannot be given such an overriding effect so as to defeat the charge and the provisions of Section 5(2)(b). The assessee appealed to this Court contending that so far as the royalty income was concerned, the assessee was maintaining its accounts at Coventry in the United Kingdom on receipt basis, that the accounting year was the year ending 30th September of each year, whereas the accounting year for the Indian Company was the Calendar year and that notwithstanding the stipulation in the collaboration agreement for half yearly remittances, the practice was that the Indian Company was determining the amount of royalty at the end of its accounting year and that this amount was credited to the account of the assessee in the account books of the Indian Company and that receipt is only when the amount is remitted to the United Kingdom in accordance with the Company. Dismissing the appeals, this Court, HELD: The collaboration agreement between the assessee and the Indian Company was as old as 1939. The assessee had been riling its income tax return in India through the Indian Company. Though the collaboration agreement contemplated the royalty amount being remitted in Sterling Currency to U.K., it cannot be said that until it was so remitted to and received in the U.K., the assessee had not received the income. The practice evidently was that the Indian Company was maintaining an account pertaining to the assessee in its Books. After it made up its accounts at the end of the calender year and determined the royalty amount payable to the assessee, the Indian Company was crediting the said amount to the account of the assessee in its Books, and this was recorded as income by the assessee over all these years. The returns riled by the assessee even with respect to the assessment years 1967 68 and 1968 69 were based upon this premise. In the said returns, the assessee declared a particular amount of income and offered the same for taxation. It did not take the stand that the said credit entry in the Books of the Indian Company did not give rise to income in India nor did it ever say that the receipt in U.K. in the shape of sterling pounds alone constitutes 99 income or for that matter receipt of income. It can also be noticed that in its returns relating to the assessment years 1967 68 and 1968 69, the assessee stated that it was maintaining its accounts on mercantile basis, and that only in the returns relating to the assessment year 1968 69, did it raise the plea that it was maintaining its books, with respect to the said royalty amount, on cash receipt basis. [105E H] The receipt of the said income in the U.K., is immaterial. It may happen that a non resident assessee may choose not to repatriate his income/profits to his parent country; he may choose to plough back the said amount in India for such purposes as he may choose. It, therefore, cannot be said in such a situation that he has not received the income in India. [106H] Raghava Red& vs C.I.T, Andhra Pradesh, ; relied on. [107A] The credit entry to the account of the assessee in the Books of the Indian Company does amount to receipt by assessee and is accordingly taxable. It is immaterial when it was actually received in U.K. [108C] The method of accounting adopted by the assessee for the relevant accounting years Is really irrelevant. Thi very concept of 'receipt\" as espoused by the assessee is untenable and unacceptable. The order of remand made by the Tribunal was unnecessary. It is not necessary to express any opinion either on the question whether there is any conflict or inconsistency between Section 5(2) and Section 145 of the Act or on the view expressed by the High Court that in the case of a non resident assessee like the appellant clause (a) of sub section (2) of Section 5 has no application whatsoever and that Section 5(2)(b) governs it irrespective of the fact whether it maintains its accounts on cash basis or mercantile basis. The question referred did not really arise in the facts and circumstances of the case and need not have been answered. The Tribunal shall complete the assessments in question. [108D F] C.I.

            "Target: Harnam Singh died leaving behind two daughters. They also died without leaving any issue surviving them. The Revenue authorities ordered that the entire estate of Harnam Singh be entered in the revenue records in the names of the defendants. The plaintiffs filed a suit for possession of the estate of Harnam Singh. Their contention was that notwithstanding the adoption of Ghuda Singh, their predecessor, by his maternal uncle, they as descendants of Ghuda Singh were not excluded from inheritance to the estate of a member in the natural family of Ghuda Singh. It was also contended that the family of the plaintiffs and Harnam Singh was governed by Zamindara Riwaj i am by virtue of which a son adopted in another family and his decendants did not lose their right to inherit in the natural family because by the adoption according to the custom of the community, the adopted son did not completely sever his connection with his natural family. The contention of defendants appellants was that in the District of Ferozeporc, every adoption in a Hindu family was formal and according to the Riwaj i am of the District, an adopted son was excluded from the right to inherit in his natural family. Consequently, Ghuda Singh, who was adopted by Bhan Singh, could not inherit the estate because his adoption operated as complete severance from the natural family. The suit was dismissed by the Subordinate judge and his order was confirmed by the District judge. However, the High Court set aside the order of the District judge and held that the record disclosed no evidence that the adoption of Ghuda Singh was formal and hence it must be presumed that the adoption was a customary appointment of an heir and not a formal adoption under the Hindu Law. It was also held that there was overwhelming authority in favour of the proposition that by reason of a customary adoption, the adopted 20 son and his descendants were not excluded from the right to inherit to collaterals in the natural family. The plaintiffs as grandsons in the male line of Ghuda Singh were entitled to inherit the estate. The appellants came to this Court by a certificate of fitness granted by High Court. Held, that the view of the High Court was correct. A person adopted according to the customs of the community, i.e. who is appointed as a heir to inherit the property of a person outside the family, does not. by virtue of such appointment, lose his right to inherit in his natural family except the right to inherit the property of his natural father when there are natural brothers.

These amounts were paid as an integral part of the commercial transaction of the sale of liquor in bottles and represented an extra price charged for the bottles. They were not security deposits as there was nothing to secure, there being no right to the return of bottles. These appeals are covered by the judgment of this Court in Punjab Distilling Industries Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income tax.

            "Prediction: The assessee who was a distiller and seller of bottled country liquor, started collecting from its customers from the year 1945 besides the price of the liquor and the bottles in which the liquor was sold, a further charge called empty bottles return security deposit. This charge was made at a certain rate per bottle delivered depending on its size on the term that it would be refunded as and when the bottles were returned to the assessee and that the entire sum collected on this account in respect of any one transaction was refunded in full on return of 90 per cent of the bottles covered by it. The Commissioner of Income tax obtained a reference of the following question to the Punjab High Court: \"Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the collections by the appellant company described in its accounts as 'empty bottle return security deposits'were income assessable under Section 10 of the Income tax Act. \" 449 In respect of the years now under consideration the Income Tax Officer taxed these charges and on\n",

            "Target: The respondent, a Company with charitable objects owned certain lands and the appellant who was the Chairman of the Board of Directors, was asked to construct a building on the said land. It was subsequently found that the cost. would be more than the estimated amount, which probably the Company was not prepared to spend. At that stage the 86 appellant made an offer that he would finish the construction of the building at his own cost and hand it over to the Company as trust property of which the Directors of the company would be the trustees and the Company will manage the affairs in accordance with the conditions laid down in his offer. The offer was accepted, but for some reason or other certain members of the Company were not prepared to stick to the original arrangement and some of the members filed a suit and obtained an injunction against the appellant and the company not to execute the trust deed as proposed by the appellant. Thereafter the appellant resigned from Chairman ship and also ceased to be a Director, two days before his resignation he appellant registered a trust deed and made himself the first trustee with powers to appoint other trustees. The trust deed inter alia, recited that a rent of Rs. 88/ per annum was to be paid to the Company for the compound where the building had been erected. Thus the appellant created a trust by which the trust became a tenant of the respondent Company without any transfer from the Company to the trust. The respondent Company called upon the appellant to hand over the building to the Company and file a suit for possession of properties, damages and mesne profit. The respondent Company 's case was that the appellant had wilfully contravened the terms of his offer, and the right of the appellant therefore 'was only to recover the money from the Company to the extent to which he may be entitled in equity and the trust deed was inoperative. The defence of the appellant inter alia was that the respondent company was estopped from claiming the building after having accepted the aforesaid offer pursuant to which the appellant had invested a large sum of money in constructing the building; and that as the offer of the trusteeship of the property in dispute made by the appellant and accepted by the Board of Directors had afterwards been cancelled as a result of the resolution passed by the general body of members, the appellant could not constitute the respondent company as trustee and therefore he was entitled to implement his original intention by executing the deed of trust. In the Supreme Court, the appellant relied on the plea that he had been granted a license and acting upon the license he had executed a work of permanent character and incurred expenses in the execution thereof and therefore under section 60(b) of the , the license was irrevocable. Held, That a Director is also a Trustee of the assets of the company and is in a fiduciary relationship with the company; therefore he could not do anything in regard 87 to the assets of the Company which would prejudicially affect its rights. A person cannot create a trust in regard to land which belonged to another person nor could he by an unilateral act create a lease in his own favour in regard to the land over which he has raised a super structure. The offer and the acceptance of the terms of the trust deed being wholly different from what had been executed by the appellant and from the manner in which the new trust had been constituted into a lessee of the company without the company 's agreement it was not possible for a Court in equity to accept the new trust as a bar to the respondent 's claim for possession and there are no equities in the appellant 's favour which he is entitled to enforce by way of defence to the suit. Held, further, that no case of license really arises but if it does, the license was to construct the building and hand it over to the respondent company as trust property. There was no license to create another kind of trust which has been sought to be created. It cannot be said, therefore, that there was an irrevocable license which fall under section 60(b) of the . Even such a license is deemed to be revoked under section 62(f) of the Act where the license is granted for a specific purpose and the purpose is attained or abandoned or becomes impracticable. G. E.

            "Target: Bhavani Tea and Produce Co., a Public Ltd. Company is engaged mainly in plantations of Tea, Coffee, Cardamom, Rubber and some other plantions in the western ghats comprising R.S Nos 2,3, 3/1 and 5/1 in Sholyar village Mannarghat Taluk of Palghat District, Kerala known as Siruvani Group of Estate of four divisions namely, Siruvani, Varddymalai, Elamali and Halton with the total area in its possession being 3, 151.20 acres. As the forest officials undertook survey over the Company 's plantations under the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting & Assignment) Act, 1971, which had come into force on 10.5.1971, to locate and determine the forest area in the estate that would vest in the State, the Company moved an application under section 8 of the Act before the Tribunal asserting that no portion of the land in the estate as shown in the schedule to the application was liable to vest in the state. An advocate commissioner was appointed by the state as vested forests. The Advocate Commissioner in his final report found an area of 1397.60 acres indentified as plots nos. 1 to 69 claimed by the State as vested forests. 551 The Company thereupon amended its application showing these 69 plots as schedule 'B ' to the application. Out of the total 3,151.20 acres 1,753.60 acres are admitted not to have vested under the Act. Of the remaining 1, 397.60 acres, 609.91 acres are admitted to be private forest on the periphery of the Estate and hence vested under the Act. This covers plots Nos. 11, 18, 25, 28, 30 and 63. Out of the remaining plots, the Tribunal allowed 33 plots totalling 206.06 acres and declared total area of 1, 184.68 acres as vested forests. Both parties preferred appeals to the High Court which by its impugned judgment partly allowed the appeal of the company as well as of the State. Both side have again preferred appeals by special leave to this court. The result of the High Court 's judgment is that the dispute before this Court is now confined only to an area of 641.73 acres covered by plots nos. 12,13,14,15,16,26,27,29,33,36,37,38,39,40,41,44,46,50,51,55, 56,58,59,61,62,64, and 65. On behalf of the company it has been argued that these disputed plots must be held to have been principally used for cultivation of tea, coffee, rubbers and cardamom etc. and for purposes ancillary thereto; that if these plots are not exempted, the plantation will be broken down in unity, economy and contiguity and that the plantation must be taken as a whole and not piece by piece or plot by plot. The argument on behalf of the State was to emphasise the objects and purposes of the vesting Act namely, to distribute agricultural land to landlords, agriculturists/labourers so as to reduce the scarcity of such land, and not to allow few individuals to remain in control. It was also contended that vesting Act did not use the word 'plantation ' and therefore private forest has to be determined on the basis of land where upon forest stands irrespective of its size. Keeping in view the detailed findings of the Tribunal as well as the High Court this Court comes to the conclusion that out of the plots which are in dispute now as pointed out above, plot nos. 33,39,40,44,46,50,51,55,58,59 and 61 also have to be treated as not to have vested in the state under the vesting Act. As regards the existing roads falling within the vested areas these shall have such margins on either side of the road as required under the PWD rules of the state and shall be maintained and controlled by the company. But no construction of new roads by the company in or through the vested areas shall be permissible. Thus in partly allowing the rival appeals by modifying the judgment of the High Court to the extent indicated above, this Court, 552 HELD: If the land was not private forest but plantation under the Madras preservation of Private Forest Act and was similarly not private forest but plantation on 10.5.1971, it could not, without anything more, become private forest thereafter even though it was not under the same efficient or successful plantation as it was earlier. Whether the plantation yielded any crop or not was not for the owners to decide and not by the authority under the Vesting Act, unless it did made specific provisions to cover such a situation. We have not been shown any such provision or any provision as to such land reverting to nature. Nature, according to Collins English Dictonary, means all natural phenomena and plant and animal life as distinct from man and his creations; a Wild primitive State untouched by man or Civilzation. According to Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, natural vegitation means self sown or planted; land not cultivated; uncultivated or undomesticated plants or animals. There is no finding as to prevalence of such a condition in these plots.[570F 571A] While, we are not inclined to agree that the entire estate of the Company was required to be taken as one whole, we find it difficult to agree that wherever some forest was found under the Company 's estate the Vesting Act would apply. We find that M.P.P.F. Act, the Kerala Forest Act, the Kerala Reforms Act, considered the plantations as Units by providing that they would include the land used for ancillary purposes as well. Therefore while applying the Vesting Act to such plantations the same principle would be applicable. It is on record that the estate of the Company is divided into four divisions. In conformity with the idea of plantations, it would be reasonable to take each division as a Unit, subject, of course, to natural and geographical factors.

            "Prediction: The appellant Bhavani Tea and Produce Co. Ltd. was a public limited company engaged mainly in plantations of Tea, Coffee, Cardamom, Rubber and other plantation crops over an extensive area in the Western Ghats close to the border of the States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

            "Target: According to r. 9(1) of the Kerala General Sales tax Rules framed under. the Kerala General Sales tax Act, 1963, in determining the taxable turnover of a dealer the excise duty, if any, paid by the dealer to the Government of Kerala or to the Central Government in respect of the goods sold by him shall be deducted. Section ,22(3) of the Act provides that if any dealer or person collects tax on transactions not liable to tax under the Act or in excess of the tax leviable under the Act such dealer or person shall pay to the Government. in addition to the tax payable, the amount so collected unless it was refunded to the person from whom it was collected. The respondent deducted the sum paid by it as excise duty from its total turnover for the purpose of determining the taxable turnover. The respondent, however, when it sold the goods. had collected, sales tax from the purchasers on the invoice prices without deducting therefrom the excise duty paid in respect of the said goods. This resulted in the respondent realising a sum in excess of the sales tax payable in respect of the goods sold by it. The Sales tax officer held that the respondent was liable to pay that amount to the Government under section 22(3). The writ petition filed by the respondent was allowed by the High Court on the ground that section 22(3) was not covered by Entry 54 of the State List in the VII Schedule to the Constitution, and hence, beyond the competence of the Slate Legislature. Dismissing the appeal to this Court. ^ HELD: (1) Entry 54 empowers the State Legislatures to make laws, except in certain cases, in respect of taxes on the sale or purchase of goods. As long as the law relates to taxes on the sale or purchase of goods, it would be within their legislative competence. But, it would not be permissible for. the State legislature to enact a law under Entry 54 for recovery by the State of an amount which could not be recovered as sales tax or purchase tax in accordance with the law on the subject and which was wrongly realised by a dealer as sales tax or purchase tax. Such a l. would not be a law relating to tax of the sale or purchase of goods but would be one in respect of an amount wrongly realised by a dealer as sales tax or purchase tax. [1 55A C] (2) The ambit of ancillary or incidental power would not go to the extent of permitting the Legislature to provide that. though the amount collected, may be wrongly, be way of tax,, was not tax, it shall still be paid over to the Government as if it were a tax. [156D E] (3) The fact that the amount realised is in excess of the tax leviable and not as amount which was not at all payable as tax, would not make any difference. Any amount realised by a dealer in excess of the tax leviable, stands, for the purpose of determining the legislative competence under Entry 54, on the same footing as an amount not due as tax under the Act. Tax, according to section 2(xxiv) of the Act, means tax payable under the Act. This necessarily means that everything outside it, collected by the dealer. would be an exaction not authorised by the Act. The amount which was realised by the respondent in excess of what was due as tax cannot be held to be tax, because, such excess amount was not tax payable under the Act. If the State Legislature cannot make a law under Entry 54 directing payment to the State of any amount collected as tax on transactions not liable to lax under the Act, it would likewise be incompetent to make a law directing payment to the State of an amount realised by a dealer in excess of the tax payable under the Act.

The respondent's accounts disclosed that it had collected from the persons to whom it sold goods a sum of Rs. 30,591.71 as sales tax in excess of the tax which the respondent was liable to pay under the Act. The appellant filed a writ petition in the Kerala High Court to challenge its liability to pay the aforesaid amount on the ground that the provisions of section 22 in so far as they imposed a liability on a dealer to pay over to the Government any amount collected by him as Sales tax, even though that amount was not payable as tax, was unconstitutional. The learned single Judge dismissed the petition filed by the appellant.

            "Target: The respondent company, in its factory set up at Madras 1959, introduced slab system of dearness allowance (DA) i.e. the DA paid to the workmen was linked to the cost of living index as well as the basic pay. The double linked DA scheme, being consciously accepted as basic constituent by the company and its workmen in various settlements between them, became basic feature of the wagestructure and remained operative in the company for about 30 years, In the year 1983, a dispute arose between the company and its workmen. The matter was referred to the industrial Tribunal. One of the issues before the Tribunal was based on the demand of the Management for restructuring of the dear ness allowance scheme and to frame a new scheme. The Tribu nal abolished the existing slab system of DA and directed the dearness allowance to be linked only to the cost of living index at 33 paise per point over 100 points at the Madras city cost of living index 1936 base. Before the High Court, both the parties agreed not to press their respective writ petitions except on the issue of restructuring of 130 DA. Upholding the findings of the Tribunal on the sole surviving issue, the Single Judge dismissed the workmen 's writ petition. The intra Court appeal filed by the workmen was also dismissed. grieved, the workmen filed the appeal by special leave to this Court. It was contended on behalf of the workmen that the Tribunal and High Court grossly erred in taking Rs. 26 as a pre war wage of a worker in Madras region and holding that the rate of neutralization on the basis of cost of living index in December, 1984 was 192%; that even assuming that there was over neutralization, the existing pay structure/DA scheme could not be revised to the prejudice of the workmen unless their pay structure was within the concept of 'living wage ' and, in addition, it was proved that financially the company was unable to bear the burden; and that the company could not be permitted to abolish the DA scheme to the detriment of the workmen much less on the plea that the said scheme was more beneficial than the DA schemes adopted by other industries in the region. The respondent, contended that the company had proved to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that financially it was not in a position to bear the burden of existing DA scheme; that its workmen were in a high wage island and as such the revision of DA scheme was justified. It was also contended that so long as there was some basis and material to vali date the award, the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution stood repelled. On the question; whether the Management is entitled to restructure the DA scheme to the prejudice of the workmen on the ground that the existing system had resulted in over neutralization thereby landing the workmen in the high wage island Allowing the appeal of the workmen, this Court, HELD: 1.1. The management can revise the wage structure to the prejudice of the workmen in a case where due to financial stringency it is unable to bear the burden of the existing wage. But in an industry or the employment where the wage structure is at the level of minimum wage, no such revision at all, is permissible not even on the ground of financial stringency.

[p. 137 C] 1.3 It is for the management, seeking to restructure the DA scheme to the disadvantage of the workmen, to prove to the satisfaction of the tribunal that the wage structure in the industry concerned is well above minimum level and the management is financially not in a position to bear the burden of the existing wagestructure. [p. 142 F] 2.1 'The concept of 'minimum wage ' is no longer the same as it was in 1936. Even 1957 is way behind. A worker 's wage is no longer a contract between an employer and an employee. It has the force of collective bargaining under the labour laws. Each category of the wage structure has to be tested at the anvil of social justice which is the live fibre of our society today. [pp. 136 H, 137 A] 2.2 The Tripartite Committee of the Indian Labour Con ference ' 1957 has formulated five norms for the fixation of 'minimum wage ' (i) three consumption units for one earner disregarding earnings of women, children and adolescents; (ii) minimum food requirement based on net intake calories; (iii) clothing requirement at 72 yards per annum for an average working family of four; (iv) house rent correspond ing to minimum area provided for under the Government 's Industrial Housing Scheme; (v) 20% of total minimum wage for fuel, lighting and other miscellaneous items.

[p. 137 A C] 2.3 In spite of the promise by the Constitution of a living wage and a 'socialist ' framework to enable the work ing people a decent standard of life, industrial wage, looking as a whole, has not yet risen higher than the level of minimum wage. [p. 137 D E] 3.1 Purchasing power of today 's wage cannot be judged by making calculations which are solely based on 30/40 years old wagestructure. The only reasonable way to determine the category of wage structure is to evaluate each component of the category concerned in the light of the prevailing prices. There has been skyrocking rise in the prices and the inflation chart is going up so fast that the only way to do justice to the labour is to determine the money value of various components of the minimum wage in the context of today. [p. 140 F H] 3.2 In the instant case, the Company neither pleaded nor argued before the Tribunal that its financial position had so much deteriorated that it was not possible for it to bear the burden of the slab system of DA; nor did the Tribunal deal with this aspect of the matter while considering the demand of the Company for re structuring the DA scheme. [p. 144 F G] 3.3 Although the DA paid by the Company was somewhat higher than what was being paid by the other similar indus tries in the region, yet it could not be shown that what was being paid by the Company was higher than what would be required by the concept of need based minimum wage. In any case there is a very long way between the need based wage and the living wage. [p. 145 AB] 4. The Tribunal and the High Court acted in total oblivion of the legal position.

The respondent challenged the same before the High Court by way of a Writ Petition contending that actually order of dismissal has been passed in the garb of an order of termination; and that the Director of the institute instead of initiating a departmental proceeding on the basis of some charges levelled against him, placed the matter before the governing council of the Institute termination of his services. The High Court gave its finding that since the service of the petitioner had been terminated because of the complaints made against him, it really amounted to his removal for alleged misconduct and so the institute should have initiated a departmental proceeding and only after due enquiry any action should have been taken. Being aggrieved by the High Courts order, the appellant Institute has preferred the present appeal. Allowing the appeal, this Court, HELD: 1.1. When an appointment is made on probation, it pre supposes that the conduct, performance, ability and the capacity of the employee concerned have to be watched and examined during the period of probation. He is to be confirmed after the expiry of probation only when his service during the period of probation is found to be satisfactory and he is considered suitable for the post against which he has been appointed. The principle of tearing of the veil for finding out the real nature of the order shall be applicable only in a case where the Court is satisfied that there is a direct nexus between the charge so levelled and the action taken. If the decision is taken to terminate the service of an employee during the period of probation, after taking into consideration the overall performance and some action or inaction on the part of such employee then it cannot be said that it amounts to his removal from service as punishment. The appointing authority at the stage of confirmation or while examining the question as to whether the service of such employee be terminated during the continuance of the period of probation, is entitled to look into any complaint made in respect of such employee while discharging his duties for purpose of making assessment of the performance of such employee. [254 E H; 255 A] 1.2. Even if such employee while questioning the validity of an order of termination simpliciter brings on the record that some preliminary inquiry or examination of some allegations had been made, that will not vitiate the order of termination.

            "Prediction: The respondent was appointed as a Lecturer in Surgical Oncology on 3rd July, 1981. He was to be on probation for a period of one year from the date of his appointment which could have been extended at the discretion of the competent authority. On one occasion it was reported that the respondent had taken away a girl on his scooter and brought her back late in the night. The said girl was an attendant to a patient in the hospital. The respondent, some complaints had been made against him to the Director of the Institute who instead of initiating a departmental proceeding on basis of charges levelled against the respondent, put up the matter before the Governing Council of the institute for termination of the service of the respondent during the period of probation. The learned Judge in view of the assertions made on behalf of the appellant directed the institute to produce the original records including certain documents and papers which had been marked as confidential. From the note of the Director it appeared that complaints had\n",

            "Target: The Government of Central Provinces and Berar (Now State of Madhya Pradesh) fixed in 1948 a scale of dearness allowance for its servants which though practically identical with the scale of dearness allowance fixed by Central Government in respect of salaries over Rs. 400 per mensem was less than it in respect of salaries for Rs. 400 per mensem or less. The petitioner State government servant challenged the validity of the order of the State Government on the ground that his fundamental right under article 14 of the Constitution had been violated inasmuch as he had a right to be equally treated with the Central Government Servants similarly situated. Held, that under the provisions of Rule 44 of the Fundamental Rules it is a matter of discretion with the local Government whether it will grant dearness allowance to any Government servant and if so how much. It imposes no duty on the State to grant it and therefore no mandamus can issue to compel the State to grant it nor can any other writ or direction be issued in respect of it as there is no right in the Government servant which is capable of being protected or enforced. Article 14 does not authorise the striking down of a law of one State on the ground that in contrast with a law of another State on the same subject its provisions are discriminatory. Nor does it contemplate a law of the Centre or of the State dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of two enactments. The sources of authority for the two statutes being different, Article 14 can have no application. Therefore 'the scale of dearness allowance sanctioned by the Central Government can furnish no ground for holding that the allowance sanctioned by the Government of Central Provinces and Berar is repugnant to Article 14. The State Government was entitled to fix the Government of India rates for one slab and Ali; different rates for another slab, 600 The Punjab Province vs Pandit Tara Chand ([1947] F.C.R. 89), and State of Bihar V. Abdul Majid ([1954] S.C.R. 786) distinguished. \n"
