The dispute between the parties is as to whether the appellant was acting within the scope of his authority when he purchased 25 shares of Tata Deferred and 350 shares of Swadeshi Mills on 11-8-1947.The Court finds that there was an agreement in writing for disputes arising out of the respondent's employment as broker to be referred to arbitration.

The case involved the amalgamation of four cooperative societies into the appellant society. The appellant sought to carry forward the accumulated losses of the amalgamated societies and set them off against its profits, but the assessing officer denied the claim. The CIT (Appeals) and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal also dismissed the appeals. The appellant argued that the amalgamated societies' rights to carry forward losses continued under Section 16(8) of the Rajasthan Co-operative Societies Act, but the court disagreed. It held that since the amalgamated societies ceased to exist, they could not file tax returns or carry forward losses. The court interpreted the tax statute strictly and emphasized that there is no equity in tax matters. The appeal was ultimately dismissed.\"\nPrediction:  \"The appellant society has appealed against the judgment delivered on 19th September, 2002 in Income Tax Appeal No.19 of 2001 by the High Court of Judicature of Rajasthan, Jaipur Bench, this appeal has been filed\n=====\nTarget:  \"A Thakurdwara of Sri Radhakrishnaji in the village of Bhadesia in the District of Sitapur is a private temple or a public one in which all the Hindus are entitled to worship.

On March 6, 1919, he had executed a will whereby he bequeathed all his lands to the temple and made provision for its proper management. The appeal is allowed, the decrees of the courts below are set aside, and a declaration granted in terms of para 17 (a) of the plaint. We are of opinion that the Thakurdwara of Sri Radhakrishnaji in Bhadesia is a public temple. The view of the lower court that the temple must be taken to have been dedicated to members of the family goes beyond the pleading, and is not supported by the evidence in the case. Some of the idols are permanently installed on a pedestal within the temple precincts, consistent with their endowment being public rather than private.\n\"\nPrediction:  \"The testator had the Thakurdwara constructed during the years 1914-1916, and the idol of Shri Radhakrishnaji ceremoniously installed therein.

Allahabad High Court held that the right of pre-emption was not one of re-purchase from the vendor but from the vendee.\n\nThe right of preemption under Muhammadan Law is a personal right on the part of the pre-emptor to get a re-transfer of the property from the vendee. It -was a right inherent in the property and hence could be followed in the hands of the purchaser whoever he might be.

No question of time- barred debts or unascertained sum can arise in this case. It would be futile to make an attempt at distinction by oversubtle argument where there is no difference in substance. It is necessary to set out briefly the history of this half a century old litigation. The seven suits out of which arise Appeals Nos. 68 to 74 were filed by Maharaja Bahadur Singh. High Court disallowed equitable set-off but still maintained this decision on this point.
