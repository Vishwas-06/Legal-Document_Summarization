The issue raised was whether the sole male surviving coparcener of the Hindu joint family, his widowed mother, and sisters constitute a Hindu undivided family within the meaning of the Income-tax Act, and whether the assessment of the income in the hands of the Hindu undivided family was correct. In this case, the property that yielded the income originally belonged to a Hindu undivided family. Upon the death of Budd Appa, the family, which included a widow and females born in the family, was represented by Buddanna alone. However, the property still continued to belong to that undivided family, and the income received from it was taxable as the income of the Hindu undivided family.\"\n",

The petitioner argues that the District Collector exceeded their authority by suspending and removing them from service without proper inquiry and without the necessary sanction. The respondent counters that the petitioner demanded and accepted gratification, but the petitioner claims they were not a public servant at the time the court took cognizance of the offense. The court concludes that since the petitioner ceased to be a public servant when the offense was recognized, no sanction was required, and therefore dismisses the petition.\"\n",

The trial judge found the petitioner guilty based on evidence and sentenced him accordingly. The appellate judge upheld the conviction without discussing the evidence in detail. The petitioner's counsel argued that the conviction relied solely on a report by a handwriting expert who was not examined.

The trial court dismissed the application due to the lack of specific particulars and a prima facie case.

On appeal by the third defendant, the High Court reversed the decision of the trial court in respect of those three items and confirmed the decision of the trial court in respect of the rest of the plaint properties. The propositus was one Shreemant who died on the 23rd November, 1941 leaving him surviving his wife Radhabai aforesaid. The controversy has narrowed down to whether the Japti Sanadi Inam lands still retain their character as Watan lands as held by the trial court, or have lost their character. The Bombay High Court held that the lands in question had ceased to be Watan lands simply because the service attaching to them had been dispensed with. There is no precedent or statutory provision directly supporting this proposition. But it has been argued that the Sanadi Inam lands were once Watan property and that once the property is impressed with the character of inam lands, they continue to bear that character.\"\n",

The case involved the widow of a deceased bank employee who applied for compassionate appointment in the bank but was declined based on the financial condition of the family. The High Court ordered reconsideration of the case, but the bank again declined the appointment. The appellant bank argued that the High Court failed to consider the scheme framed by the bank, which allows compassionate appointment only in cases of penury and indigent circumstances. The appellant bank also highlighted the terminal benefits paid to the family and the financial security provided. The respondents argued that the family's income was below the threshold set by the bank's policy for compassionate appointment. The court considered the previous judgments on employment on compassionate grounds and concluded that appointments should be based on the financial condition of the family. In this case, the financial condition was not penurious, and the bank's decision to decline the appointment was upheld. The court emphasized the discretion of the competent authority in such matters and criticized the High Court for interfering with their findings.\"\n",
